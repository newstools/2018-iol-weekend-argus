Johannesburg - The family of rapper Jabulani Tsambo, popularly known as HHP, on Thursday said it would not respond to the "outrageous and sensational" claims made by Lerato Sengadi in her court application. Sengadi on Thursday morning filed an urgent court application seeking to bar his parents from burying him this Saturday in Mahikeng. She also wants all goods belonging to the late rapper, including hard drives taken from his studio.   Tsambo family spokesperson Nkululeko Ncana in a statement confirmed that the family was aware of the court bid and said their lawyers were currently dealing with the matter. "As law abiding citizens we have full confidence in our courts and believe that a reasonable outcome in the interest of justice will be arrived at. "In the immediate, we will not be responding to Sengadi's outrageous and sensational claims contained in her founding affidavit, which seek to impugn the good image and person of Jabba. Ncana further said that: "At the appropriate time, the shameful untruths peddled with the aim soliciting sympathy from an unsuspecting public will be adequately addressed. It is deplorable and in bad taste that rather than mourning Jabba, matters of self interest and grandstanding are elevated above all else, especially during this painful period. "The desire to prevent our family from giving Jabba a dignified send-off is insensitive and atrocious at best, and at worst, the action is tantamount to an act of violence on the memory and legacy of Jabba, who touched millions of lives through his music and personal interactions with his fans." He said that it was a shame that HHP was not around "to dismiss the lies that have been peddled about him. Everyone that ever crossed his path will attest to his loving nature". * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. IOL
