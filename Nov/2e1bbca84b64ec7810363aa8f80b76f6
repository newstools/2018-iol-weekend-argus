Cape Town - South Africa's first car sharing platform, RentMyRide, has launched and it allows car owners to rent out their car to anyone to earn extra money. Membership is free with insurance options on all rentals with comprehensive policies of up to R10 000. Users sign up to the platform and list their car following a few steps before being ready to rent out their car. According to RentMyRide chief executive, Sebastian Brokmann, RentMyRide empowers people by giving them the tools for a low-tech small business and creating competition for conventional car rental companies by being a more affordable, paper-free and a hassle-free online facilitator. "The goal was to disrupt traditional car rental companies by allowing individuals to support locals who can then earn an income by renting out their vehicles. The concept of peer-to-peer car sharing is a big business globally and growing," said Brokmann. Some of the key features of the service include:   Some of RentMyRide’s top earners are generating up to R20 000 per month, establishing themselves as entrepreneurs or supplementing their income and creating new opportunities for themselves and their families. The sharing economy is thriving and car sharing platforms in the Netherlands and America, like Snappcar and Turo have paved the way for this concept. @WeekendArgus  wknews@inl.co.za  Weekend Argus
