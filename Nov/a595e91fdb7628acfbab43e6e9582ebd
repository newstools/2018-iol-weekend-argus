The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have hired an interior designer whose previous clients include the Beckhams to refurbish their Cotswolds home. The couple are understood to have asked Vicky Charles to transform their property in the Oxfordshire village of Great Tew. Charles and her business partner Julia Corden – the wife of TV star James Corden who acted as compère at Harry and Meghan’s wedding party in May – have emerged as the nexus of the Sussex social circle. In addition to David and Victoria Beckham, their company Charles & Co has worked for other celebrity friends of Harry and Meghan, including George and Amal Clooney and Gordon and Tana Ramsay. A source said: ‘Vicky is so ridiculously in demand. She has many, many high-profile clients.’ As well as kitting out nurseries at three of the Clooneys’ properties, Ms Charles – who is close to Canadian Markus Anderson, one of Meghan closest pals – revamped the main home of the film star and barrister in Sonning, Berkshire. Ms Charles previously worked for the exclusive private members’ club Soho House – overseeing the interior design of its branches in Malibu, Chicago and Barcelona. It has a country club, Soho Farmhouse, near the royal couple’s Great Tew home. The Mail on Sunday revealed last month how Harry and Meghan have revelled in their new bolthole, hosting pals including Serena Williams and actress Priyanka Chopra. Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, has twice stayed with them in Oxfordshire. At the time of writing, Kensington Palace declined to comment.
