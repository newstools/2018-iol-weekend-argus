Cape Town - President Cyril Ramaphosa sent a stern warning to gangsters and drug lords saying their reign of terror would soon be over. Ramaphosa was speaking at the launch of the SAPS Anti-gang Unit in Hanover Park, south of Cape Town on Friday where he did a walkabout in the community listening to various complaints about gang violence.  The president said gangsters should be aware that the streets of Hanover Park did not belong to them and that their days were numbered. “We are not afraid of you. We are coming after you,” Ramaphosa said. He said communities should not live in fear of gangsters but should report gang activity to the police. Ramaphosa said a hotline where members of the public would be able to report anonymously, would be established soon.      He also sent a message to members of the public to keep children in school to save them from a life of crime. He said he would introduce a law which would compel parents to keep their children in school until matric. “I am concerned about the number of children not at school in this community. We have free education, children of school-going age should be in school on school days,” the president said. The Unit will be powered by 95 members under the leadership of Major General Andre Lincoln. At least 50 vehicles including vans, bakkies and high-performance BMW hatchbacks were handed over to Lincoln and the Unit. “We will not disappoint you. We will bring peace and stability to the streets again,” said Lincoln. While the launch happened in Cape Town, Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal, and the Eastern Cape would also be getting specialised anti-gang units according to the National Anti-gangsterism Strategy. Minister of Police Bheki Cele, Deputy Minister Bongani Mkhongi, National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole and Premier Helen Zille also attended the launch. Weekend Argus
