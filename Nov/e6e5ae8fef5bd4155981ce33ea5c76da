Cape Town - Three people were killed after a car collided with a bridge pillar on Liesbeek Parkway North under N2 in Cape Town. It is believed that the driver lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the fatal accident. "All three occupants of the motor vehicle, two males and one female, sustained fatal injuries," said City of Cape Town's traffic spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhout. There are lane restrictions in place. Southbound traffic has been diverted onto N2 outgoing and northbound traffic has been diverted to incorrect side. Motorists are to expect delays of up to an hour due to the lane restrictions.
