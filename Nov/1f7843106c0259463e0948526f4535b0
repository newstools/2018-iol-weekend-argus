Cape Town – Former mayor Patricia de Lille laid charges of fraud and defamation against four senior DA members, including two MPs, at the Cape Town Central police station in Buitenkant Street on Thursday. DA member Henk Hugo, DA KwaZulu-Natal deputy provincial chairperson Shehana Kajee, DA deputy chief whip Mike Waters and National Council of Provinces MP Bronwyn Engelbrecht face charges of sharing or distributing a fake Auditor-General report. They had ignored a deadline given by De Lille in October to publicly apologise for what she said were defamatory statements. She later lodged a complaint with the Office of Speaker Baleka Mbete against two DA MPs, whose actions, she charges, were at odds with Parliament’s Code of Ethics by disrespecting a Chapter 9 institution. De Lille said she was laying the charges as her current employment state allowed her the time to do so. “I am taking this action because of the serious nature of the fraud as well as the total disregard and disrespect shown to the Office of the Auditor-General by public representatives. "I am also doing this because I value the rights and protection that our constitution should afford our society and citizens, because I love my country and because I want to ensure that all citizens are treated equally and protected by the laws that we fought so hard for,” she said. De Lille said she was disappointed that the DA had reportedly indicated that it was not necessary for its members to apologise for these deplorable actions and that once again its funders were committed to pay for further unwinnable court action.
