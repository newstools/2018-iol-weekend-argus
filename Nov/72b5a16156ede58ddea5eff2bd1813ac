Cape Town - Around 800 delegates have gathered in Cape Town for the continentâ€™s largest Agricultural trade and investment gathering. The two-day African Agri Investment Indaba is at the Cape Town International Convention Centre from November 28 to 29. The Indaba has been classified as a global meeting place for agri investment in Africa which brings together key stakeholders from government officials, banks, financiers, investors, project owners and developers as well as commercial farmers and those from the agro-processing industry. The aim is to bring all role players under one roof to discuss trends that are likely to influence food and agribusiness economics over the next 10 years in Africa. And with parts of the Western Cape still affected by droughts, discussions around the affects of climate change on the industry will be high on the agenda. Speakers listed on the programme include, Western Cape Premier, Helen Zille, as well as other key role players from all over the continent as well as the USA and Brazil. wknews@inl.co.za Weekend Argus
