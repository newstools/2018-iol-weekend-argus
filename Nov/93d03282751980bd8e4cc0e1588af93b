Neethling, marketing director for Val de Vie Estate, is so taken with the sport that he has entered the race and will host his own event at Val de Vie in Franschhoek in 2019. “At Val de Vie we are promoting a healthy outdoor lifestyle and to that end, we host trail runs, have developed more than 40km of MTB trails, host the polo as well as our monthly markets, and so to add a Torpedo SwimRun event is a great fit for us,” said Neethling. SwimRun is an adventure sport that combines swimming and running in some of the most beautiful places on earth. It was started in Sweden eight years ago. It now boasts 450 events around the world, including right here in the Western Cape. SwimRun is different in that athletes run in their wetsuits and swim in their running shoes - there are no transitions like you have in triathlon. Torpedo SwimRun Wild was launched in the Wilderness area in September this year, with a 6km pre-race and a 26km main event made up of multiple segments of swimming, running and “swambling”, which is a rugged combination of swimming and scrambling over rocks. Co-founder of Torpedo SwimRun, Richard McMartin, said one of the reasons they are so thrilled about Val de Vie as the next event, is that this one will make SwimRun so much more accessible to new participants. “The swimming is in dams, with the longest swim being 400m, and it is not as technical as the other events. We are also able to cater for a larger number of athletes. The longest run is 3km. With 2kms of swimming in total and 8km of total running, the whole race is 10km," said McMartin. Tomorrow's event will be the third edition of the pinnacle Torpedo SwimRun Cape. This event has grown significantly since the inaugural event in January 2017 and now attracts top athletes who will be competing for R100 000 in prize money. A strong SwimRun community has developed over the course of 2017 - 2018, and the sport is fast gaining momentum, especially amongst lifesavers and triathletes.
