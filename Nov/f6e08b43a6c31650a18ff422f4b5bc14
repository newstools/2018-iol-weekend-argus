The ANC in the City of Cape Town has called for an investigation into Mayoral Committee member, JP Smith for alleged misconduct and covering up serious allegations against the head of Law Enforcement. The council held a special confidential meeting today where it took a decision to launch an investigation into the conduct of Executive Director of Safety and Security, Richard Bosman following complaints laid by a member of the public. The allegations relate to false charges that Director ofÂ  Law Enforcement, Petrus Roberts purportedly on the instructions of Smith and Bosman. The charges were later withdrawn but after Roberts had submitted affidavits in support of the false allegations. ANC Spokesperson, Xolani Sotashe, said while the council agreed to institute an investigation into Bosman, the probe should be extended to include Smith. He accused Smith of being involved in the "irregular" appointment of Roberts, whom he alleged was not the best candidate for the position as there were others who were better qualified. "He has done what he had orchestrated against former mayor Patricia De Lille by accusing him of interfering with the then city manager. He too must be investigated," Sotashe said. Smith said he welcomed the investigation "so that we can clear his (Bosman) name". "They can't investigate me as I have nothing to do with recruitment and selection processes", he added. wknews@inl.co.za Weekend Argus
