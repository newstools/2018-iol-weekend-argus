Prominent #FeesMustFall activist Masixole Mlandu tweeted a few pages from his politics Honours research project titled “The Coloniser/Colonised Dialectic: A look into the settler - colonialism as a socio-economic order of South Africa”. The acknowledgement section thanked his mother, adviser and friends, and ended thanking the Pan-Africanist Student Movement of Azania for fighting for the emancipation of black people. It concluded: “One settler, one bullet”. Phakeng commented: “Congratulations. dear son, on completing this paper! I would like to study it at some stage I am proud of you!” Backlash followed as social media users including DA Student Organisation said they were shocked at the endorsement of the slogan and said they saw the comments as “vile, polarising and bordering on racism”.      Phakeng distanced herself from the threats of violence in the dissertation. “Like the VC, UCT distances itself and we do not condone such language It’s divisive and, in our view, not constructive,” UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola said in a statement. Mlandu said the comment in his dissertation had done exactly what he intended, which was to start a conversation on the settler influence in society today. “To be offended by ‘one settler, one bullet’ is to agree that you’re a settler - an exploiter,” he said.
