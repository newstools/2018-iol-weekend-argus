Cape Town - Judgment proceedings are underway in the Cape High court in the Courtney Pieters murder trial. Mortimer Saunders, who shared a house with the family in Elsies River, is on trial for the rape and murder of the little girl. Her body was found on May 13, 2017 near a dumping site in Epping and was positively identified by her parents the next day. The body of the child was discovered nine days after she disappeared from her home. Saunders was part of a search party that went looking for the girl shortly after her disappearance. Pieters died of strangulation and poisoning. Judge Pearl Montame is meticulously reading her 82-page judgment and has set aside three days to wrap up proceedings. Court 15, a very small court, is packed to the rafters with members of the Elsies River community. A few women from the Elsies River community are wearing purple t-shirts saying, 'Courtney gone but not forgotten' with a montage of pictures of the little girl. A clean-shaven Saunders, who was sporting a blue shirt and tan leather jacket, sat quietly listening to judge Montame. The judge again read the credentials and evidence of the expert witnesses who testified during the trial. The packed courtroom is surprisingly quiet as everyone strains to hear the very soft voice of judge Montame. Weekend Argus
