She was welcomed into the Royal Family much later than her sister-in-law. But already the Duchess of Sussex has overtaken the Duchess of Cambridge in a list of the most powerful fashion ‘influencers’. Meghan came third, while Kate slipped from fifth to 16th in this year’s report by shopping site Lyst. She was beaten only by reality stars – and half-sisters – Kylie Jenner, 21, and Kim Kardashian, 38. To compile the rankings, Lyst monitored online searches, press coverage and sales of particular outfits worn by celebrities. The website said that every time Meghan, 37, wears a designer item, the brand will see a 200 per cent search increase the week after. It added: ‘Her wedding day outfits caused huge spikes for both Givenchy and Stella McCartney, while her daytime looks have also inspired millions of shoppers to try a “boat neck” or “tuxedo dress”.’ Meghan wore a chic black tuxedo dress to a performance of hit musical Hamilton in August. Boat neck dresses and tops are another staple of hers. The olive-green piece she wore to Prince Louis’s christening has proven especially popular in the months since. Pop stars dominate the rest of this year’s list. Rapper Cardi B came fourth, Beyonce fifth, Rihanna ninth and Ariana Grande tenth. © Daily Mail
