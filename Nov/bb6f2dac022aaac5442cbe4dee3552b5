As the couple made their way down the line-up, both seemed delighted to meet the musical’s cast again a few months after seeing the show on stage. They smiled broadly as host Greg Davies welcomed them to their first show as a couple – which generated a huge round of applause. Harry was unaccompanied when he made his only other appearance at the Royal Variety Performance in 2015. The shows began in 1912 under the reign of George V and are always attended by a member of the Royal Family. There have been a total of 82 performances across 17 theatres and they are held in aid of the Royal Variety Charity, of which the Queen is Patron. The money raised goes to entertainers throughout the UK who are in need of assistance. © Daily Mail
