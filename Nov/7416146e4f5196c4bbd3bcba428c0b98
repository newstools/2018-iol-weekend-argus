There will be two races on the day: the fun run, which stretches over 4.2km, and the main race of 10km. The annual race commemorates December 16, the Day of Reconciliation, for the 19th time. “The race was started with the purpose of reconciliation and bringing a culture of running to Gugs,” said Shoko. He added that the race welcomed people of all backgrounds in the previous years. “Gugs residents always come out in full support of the race. Over the years it has grown exponentially.” Shoko said they expect about 2000 participants in this year’s race. “In terms of the economy, what we do is we get churches, the youth and Bambanani involved. “They come in and help and we pay all the people who help us out.” He said there were a few businesses which benefited from the race. As event organiser, Shoko has short and long-term goals for the event. “I would love to see more and more participants from Gugulethu enjoying the race. There are more participants from outside than there are from Gugulethu.”
