Damons, who worked in the Zeven River Estate in Stellenbosch for 36 years, claims he had been living without electricity since August 21 after Harold Johnson cut off his electricity. A source close to the case, and numerous news sites, lists Johnson as co-owner of the Zeven- wacht Estate in Kuils River. Damons’s attorney Piet September said Johnson had been using con- structive eviction to oust Damons and his family. Damons showed the Weekend Argus his electricity card, for which he had been paying R135 per week to be topped up. This publication also saw electricity slips of the farm’s current workers, who were paying R65 per week for their electricity cards. “As a pensioner, I receive a monthly grant and we have no means of income. I get it I can’t live for free, I have to pay electricity and I do, but (Johnson) is deliberately trying to push me out.” The court order, dated last Thursday, stated that Johnson reconnect Damons, who again paid R135 for this week’s electricity. On Wednesday, when the Weekend Argus visited Damons, September engaged in heated exchange with the foreman of the farm, Francois Loubscher, over the phone. September said he was waiting for Damons’s instruction on whether to open a criminal case. This hinges on whether Johnson disobeys the order next week. Johnson rubbished Damons’s claim, saying his power had been reconnected and that Damons refused to pay R30 a week rent. “That’s not money; it’s about principle.” Johnson, who is appealing the court order, has also taken Damons to court for accusing him of forging their lease deal. “He’s a sly guy. I’m agitated, he calls us frauds. I sponsor people that work for us (hence they pay R65 electricity per week),” he said. Derrick Hendrickse, EFF councillor in the Stellenbosch area, said Johnson had victimised Damons for years.
