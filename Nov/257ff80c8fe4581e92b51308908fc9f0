Cape Town is fast positioning itself as the tech hub of Africa with innovative start-up companies springing up almost monthly. This week, 10 start-up tech company finalists pitched to investors and tech gurus at the Startupbootcamp AfriTech demo day, where these companies were able to showcase their business ideas based on finance, insurance and transport. “Passengers are able to be more productive and relaxed knowing that their shuttle will pick them up on time and deliver them to their door, relieving them from having to walk long distances after hours in unsafe areas,” said Mboweni. He added that the system was the first cashless, mobile payments ticketing system for shared transport.
