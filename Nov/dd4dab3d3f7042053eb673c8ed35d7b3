Cape Town - With the windy season in Cape Town almost here, the deadline for the video entry process for the Red Bull King of the Air 2019 kiteboarding contest draws nearer. The event returns to Kite Beach in Table View, Cape Town where it was staged successfully last year and will have a window period of two weeks in late January and early February with the competition due to be run on the windiest day. Entries are open to riders from anywhere in the world, but there are only a few spots available. The 2019 rider list will be made up of the top 9 from the 2018 event with the remaining spots decided through the video entry process. Contestant Joshua Emanuel said kiteboarders who like to go big and push the boundaries of the sport should submit their entries for the event. "It takes a lot of training to make sure you've got what it takes to compete. As you will be competing against the best in the world who have been doing this for a very long time. There is a lot of 'off the book' training as you need to make sure your body is strong enough to take big crashes, as well as endure long training sessions in extreme wind. I focus on a lot of body weight training and cardio to get through my training regime," he said. Emanuel said Jessie Richman, Nick Jacobsen, Kevin Langree, Steven Akkersdijk are the competitors to keep an eye on this year and would "keep me on my toes". "To win the competition you need to put a lot of time into your style, the height and how extreme you can go. When you have all the elements lined up perfectly your chance of taking the win would be pretty good." Kiteboarders who think they have what it takes to compete in with the world’s best aerialists in an extreme air contest are invited to submit a one-minute video of their biggest airs to redbullkingoftheair.com Entries close on November 30. luke.folb@inl.co.za Weekend Argus
