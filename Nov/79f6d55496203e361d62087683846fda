DebtSafe spokesperson Matthys Potgieter said recent feedback and statistics from the DebtSafe Credit Savvy survey, which used 1070 respondents, highlights that 56% of South African consumers regret taking out the credit. Potgieter said consumers’ overall reasons for taking out credit included: About 37% indicated that living expenses needed to be covered and 21% considered obtaining credit to pay for school fees, while 21% were thinking about buying a new vehicle. Respondents’ kind of credit mostly consisted of unsecured debt: 31% had credit card debt and 44% had personal loans. A total of 27% respondents indicated that they had previously taken out credit knowing they might not be able to afford monthly repayments. Even though consumers should know by now that they ought to be accountable credit users - not taking out credit or debt that they cannot afford - the temptation was real. Around 55% said they received one phone call, email or SMS from credit providers (offering extra credit) per day. Whatever the situation, it was the duty of the consumer to “handle” credit responsibly, said Potgieter. “Credit is not necessarily a bad thing, but how consumers manage their debt and credit obligations makes it either a very bad or extremely good situation.” Potgieter said that when consumers took out credit, it came with great responsibility. “If this is not properly managed, consumers can consider themselves ‘reckless borrowers’ - a reputation that should be avoided.” What should consumers take into account when it comes to credit and ‘reckless borrowing’? They have to be sure that when they apply for credit that they can afford it. They can do their necessary research regarding products, and shop around for better prices if necessary.
