Veteran city councillor Nieuwoudt first served on the environmental and spatial planning portfolio committee from 2011 to 2015. She has a post-graduate degree in management and has served as the deputy chair in the finance portfolio. Mayor Dan Plato replaced Johan van der Merwe on the mayoral committee with Nieuwoudt. Nieuwoudt said her focal point in the city’s finances was to adhere to the findings of the auditor-general “and rectify those negative findings in (that) report”. “It is in everybody’s interest that our processes are clear, accountable and trustworthy.” Regarded as a feisty and meticulous councillor in Sub-council 2 in Kraaifontein, Nieuwoudt clashed with former mayor Patricia de Lille after the latter allegedly instructed DA councillors to vote in Clive Justus as chairman and replace councillor Grant Twigg as chairperson of the sub-council. This move is largely seen as the tipping point in the relationship between DA Metro chairperson Twigg and De Lille. Nieuwoudt said: “I want to place on record that I never had a gripe with the former mayor Patricia de Lille, but I merely executed (DA) caucus decisions in voting for the new chairperson of the Kraaifontein Sub-council in 2016. The former New National Party politician said detractors who use her past position to label her as an anti-transformation agent don’t bother her. “Not at all, detractors are entitled to their views. I have learnt that action speaks louder. My focus is on accountable service delivery and not on a war of words.” Asked about her short- and long-term goals for the finance portfolio, she said: “We need to get back at the level of excellence service delivery and assure good governance through policies. We cannot compromise affordability and a re-assessment of the tariffs is urgent required. “Both portfolios (planning and environment and finance) are core to the sustainability of the city and the well-being of our citizens.”
