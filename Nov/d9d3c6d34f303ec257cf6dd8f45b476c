Cape Town - The trial of the man accused of killing his twins is being delayed because of squabbles over the payment of interpreters. Spanish dentist, Mario-César Deus Yela faces charges of premeditated murder in the Western Cape High Court. The 50 years old dentist allegedly killed his three-year-old twins, Octavia and Maximo Engelhorn at a holiday apartment in Hout Bay on April 6,  2017. He is also accused of assaulting his ex-wife, Julia Engelhorn. Judge Mustak Parker on Monday morning appealed to the State prosecutor, Louise Friester-Sampson and defense attorney, William Booth, to work together “in the interest of justice” to find a suitable Spanish interpreter so that the trial can commence on April 29, 2019. Interpreters are paid R1500 per day but some of the Spanish interpreters are demanding higher fees for their services and this often results in a mad scramble for a suitable interpreter. Defense attorney, William Booth lamented that he had to use the services of at least 9 interpreters in a previous case because of the unhappiness over-payment. While Yela understands English to a large extent, Booth said his client’s comprehension of the language was not at a level for trial proceedings. “I am making it known that I am concerned about the delays. You both must nag whomever you need to nag to secure the services of an interpreter, “ said Parker to Friester-Sampson and Booth. He also asked that he be kept updated about the search for a suitable interpreter and they will convene again on February 4, 2019 to see if the trial can proceed on April 29. Weekend Argus
