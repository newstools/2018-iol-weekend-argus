Johannesburg - A stealthy two-day police hunt proved to be the downfall of the mysterious man accused of killing and burying the bodies of seven Vlakfontein people, among whom were children. The 27-year-old, who police confirmed on Sunday was living a double life with different aliases, couldn’t escape their clutches over the weekend after he was released on Thursday due to a lack of evidence. He then fled to Mpumalanga shortly after his release from custody, but was recaptured on Saturday in the Mpumalanga town of Lebombo, which is near the border with Mozambique. Police said last week that sharp objects were used to carry out these brutal murders, where three adults and four children, the youngest of whom was a 2-year-old girl, were buried in different parts of the property. On Sunday, Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said police had been tracking their target since Thursday, expressing confidence that they had nabbed their man. “We had arrested him and taken him in for questioning, but we couldn’t link him (to the crimes). “We managed to re-arrest him on Saturday because now we believe we have a strong case against him and we can link him to the murders,” Masondo said, adding that he would also face a number of rape charges. Another man, who was arrested on Saturday in Soweto, will also face murder charges, Masondo said. The man, 61, was in a relationship with one of the victims. Masondo could not confirm whether the two suspects, who will appear in the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court on Monday, were related. He did, however, confirm that the murder and rape suspect was using two names, which are both known to The Star. Masondo could not confirm the names and nationalities of the suspects but The Star has reliably established that at least one of them is Zimbabwean. @khayakoko88 The Star
