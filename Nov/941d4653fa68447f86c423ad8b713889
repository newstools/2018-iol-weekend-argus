CAPE TOWN: AS the DA grapples with eight councillors resigning in City of Cape Town more wards will be contested next month in by-elections in three other municipalities, in other parts the province. The Independent Electoral Commission completed voter registrations for by-elections in the Matzikama, Saldanha By and Cederberg Municipalities on December 12. Ward, 6 in the Matzikama became vacant after a councillor had his membership with the DA terminated. This follows drama in the council when the DA lost control of the municipality in July when a ‘rogue’ councillor voted with ANC councillors to vote in an ANC mayor, Willem Nell, following the resignation of DA councillor Rhenda Stephen who resigned shortly before a motion of no confidence was to be tabled against her. The ward has over 4 000 registered voters and five voting districts where voting will take place. The position in ward four in Cederberg became vacant after former DA mayor, Jimmy Barnard resigned and was replaced by William Farmer as mayor.   Ward five in Saldanha Bay also saw its councillor, Frank Pronk resigning. The Cederberg ward has around 3 100 registered voters who have access to three voting districts while the Saldanha Bay ward has 3 500 voters and two stations. Weekend Argus
