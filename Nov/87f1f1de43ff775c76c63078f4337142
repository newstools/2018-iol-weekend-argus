Safety and Security Mayco member JP Smith said the 36-year-old was handed over to the local SAPS for further investigation, while the woman was referred for trauma counselling. “This incident underscores the importance of vehicle checkpoints and random stops,” he said. “It is not the first case of this nature that has been uncovered by our officers. ‘‘With the mooted introduction of a 24-hour traffic presence on our roads, our staff will be able to man more vehicle checkpoints – an invaluable tool in crime fighting, as it often lifts the lid on criminals after the fact, or puts a spanner in the works for planned criminal activity,” Smith said.
