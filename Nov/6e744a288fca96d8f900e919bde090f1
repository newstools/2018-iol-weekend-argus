JOHANNESBURG – Former Minister of Public Enterprises (DPE) Malusi Gigaba was provided security by Transnet during the tenure of Brian Molefe as chief executive of the company. A forensic report into Transnet whistleblowers approached investigators and told them that the then Minister of DPE Gigaba was lenient to Molefe because he provided special protection to the Minister using Transnet personnel. The investigations found that two security personnel were hired earing in excess of R300 000 each to protect Gigaba. The two security officers are David Machete and Bongani Zwane. The report said the two were appointed unlawfully. "Transnet appointed Zwane and Machete without following the Transnet Recruitment processes in that the appointments of the two security officers were not advertised and further there were no interviews conducted," reads the report. "Zwane and Machete were appointed under the pretext that they were going to provide security services to the Transnet Group executives when in truth and in fact they were appointed to provide security services to Minister Gigaba." Gigaba's explanation on why he used Transnet security:   However, investigators found Gigaba’s explanation to be devoid of truth. “The version provided by Gigaba is in contradiction with the version provided to us by the then Head of Security at DPE, Isaac Manyathela,” investigators said. “While Manyathela confirmed that there was a security assessment by SAPS on the provision of additional resources to Minister Gigaba, he (Manyathela) indicated that Minister Gigaba and the Ministry’s staff approached Transnet and sourced security personnel for the Minister.” BUSINESS REPORT
