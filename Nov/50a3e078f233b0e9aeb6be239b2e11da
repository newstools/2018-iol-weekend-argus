“Our inspectors are all out until way after nightfall every day and back on duty before light the next morning searching for animals affected by the fires,” Garden Route SPCA chairperson Wendy Jones said. This past week, officers have faced horrific scenes of severely injured and scorched animals. One of the most heartbreaking scenes was in the Karatara area where field officer Vanessa Lucas found a chained dog burnt to death next to a home. She found another dog in the same area that had died from smoke inhalation. Jones said they had dealt with many injured animals, mostly with burnt feet and stomachs. “We have also been helping find lost pets.” To facilitate this, the George SPCA moved animals to the Mossel Bay branch to make space for rescued pets. “We have literally used every available space, including offices, to accommodate the animals.” Some experienced hikers have also joined the inspectors in the search. Plettenberg Bay-based wildlife rehabilitation centre Tenkiwa has offered to assist any wild animals affected by the fires. “We have received a baby caracal that got separated from its mother and we are not sure if the mother survived. “We are expecting more animals to arrive,” centre spokesperson Elzette Lategan said. Residents are encouraged to contact Cape Nature George regional office on 0448025300 if they find animals in need of help, but not to leave food out. Outeniqua Nature Reserve is on 0870874151 if wounded animals are found inside the reserve. @WeekendArgus  wknews@inl.co.za  Weekend Argus
