Cape Town - The DA in the Garden Route District Municipality has lauded the work of firefighters who worked tirelessly to contain blazes that destroyed over 92 hectares of land. This as mop up operations continue in the area while burnout operations are underway to contain smaller fires that are still active in other areas. Wildfires have been ongoing in the region for the last three weeks. The municipality announced on Tuesday morning that Spitskop is still being monitored due to an active fire affecting three hectares on the mounting which is inaccessible to ground crews. The party’s Tertuis Simmers said the fires that have ravaged through the area in the last couple of weeks destroyed around 21 structures while 26 structures have sustained damaged. “We are saddened by the loss of the Old Toll House, 3700 ha of plantations and particularly the loss of lives and those who have been displaced,” he said. “I will be writing to the minister of Local Government and Agriculture to inquire on what and which form of provincial government assistance will be given to local communities and farmers where more than 92 000 ha was destroyed.     “The reason behind the rise in recent blazes across the district is not yet known, yet weather conditions have hampered attempts to extinguish fires and resources have been seriously tied up due to the multiple blazes in the district.” WEEKEND ARGUS
