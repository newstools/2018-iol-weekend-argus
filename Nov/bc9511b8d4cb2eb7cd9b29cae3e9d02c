Winde appeared relaxed and confident before he commented on his move from economic opportunities to his new portfolio. In the former department, his role was expanding the economy, now his task is to shrink crime. Just how will he achieve this? Innovation and technology, Winde says. “We’ve started something called Securi-Tech (started at economic development). This region is the Silicon Valley of the continent. The future of a Fourth Industrial Revolution economy involves technology. “How do we use technology now to fight crime? I will give you a much clearer idea in 100 days.” Winde, the DA candidate for Western Cape premier in the 2019 elections, cited the Statistics SA quarterly review which described the Western Cape as the highest contributor to employment in the economy. “Now I’ve got to look at the long-term as a region. Our poorer communities are under severe pressure when it comes to crime. This is where we’ve got to make a difference. We’ve got to build proper partnerships; proper mechanisms in which to change them.” Winde is set to meet provincial police commissioner Lieutenant- General Khombinkosi Jula for talks. On his short- and long-term goals, Winde said: “I like to set long-term visions. Strategically, in my mind, crime is one of the biggest issues facing our region. “This is a big ask and what I’m going to be doing is to make sure everyone is working in the same direction to make this a safer place in which to live, bring up your family and in which to invest.” Winde said his department would work closely with 16000 members of the 231 neighbourhood watch groups in the province.
