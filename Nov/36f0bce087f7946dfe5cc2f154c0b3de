The youngsters have been invited to play at the Manchester Cup and Dubai Cup soccer tournaments, but need financial assistance. They were selected by the South Africa Schools Football Association (Safta) after attending soccer trials at the Athlone Astro-Turf in October. The school says this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity can only happen if each child’s parents can raise R42 500. Coach Channing Jooste said the boys needed to pay their fees in full by February, but also had to meet monthly payment deadlines. The first payment is due on November 30. At present the learners, parents and school have raised R4500, well short of their target. “The school gave them a collection list. The SGB is planning fund-raisers at the school early next year and the boys may receive dollars from an American sponsor,” said Jooste. Two squads from the Cape Region will represent their districts at the tournaments in Manchester and Dubai. The youngsters are from Mowbray, Manenberg and Gugulethu.
