Cape Town – A panic-stricken female motorist managed to evade would-be hijackers by reversing in double quick time and smashing into other cars in Blomvlei Road in Lansdowne. Video footage from @1SecondLater on Twitter shows the woman's car approaching an intersection at Blomvlei Road on Monday before being cut off by a black Mercedes-Benz. Two people can be spotted getting out of the Mercedes, but before they can reach her she reverses into two vehicles in the next lane, completing a destructive three-point turn to avoid becoming a hijack victim. This scares off the would-be hijackers and they jump back into their vehicle before speeding off. The crime scene was temporarily closed down, with 1SecondLater reporting that shots had been fired during the incident. "This was her reaction as she was being shot at, bullets went into the dashboard of the car. Definitely a fight or flight reaction," @1SecondLater posted. Police confirmed that attempted hijacking and attempted robbery cases had been registered for investigation. Anyone with any information about the incident was requested to contact Crime Stop on 089 600 10111.
