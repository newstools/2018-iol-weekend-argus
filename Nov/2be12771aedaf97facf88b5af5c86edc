Cape Town - The DA has retained its ward in the George municipality following a by-election on Wednesday. The DA’s Erika Louise Brown was elected as the new councillor for Ward 3, ensuring the party retained the seat they won in the 2016 municipal election beating The ward became vacant as a result of the resignation of a councillor and the DA won the election by 80.60% of the votes to beat Johan Du Toit of the ACDP, Richard Sedi of the EFF, and Marthinus Johannes Erasmus of the Freedom Front Plus.    The Independent Electoral Commission also announced that a by-election that was meant to take place on Wednesday in Ward 9 in the Witzenberg municipality was pushed back to December 5. This after the EFF and the ANC lodged a complaint with the IEC stating that they were barred from canvassing for votes on farms while the DA was given access. IEC spokesperson, Kate Bapela said: “The Electoral Commission approached the Electoral Court to request the postponement of this by-election beyond the 90-day period (which expires on 7 December 2018) in view of certain political party contestants not being granted access to certain farms in Ward 9 for campaigning purposes. “However, the Electoral Court did not grant the Electoral Commission permission to extend this by-election beyond the 90-day period, and hence the by-election has been proclaimed for 5 December 2018.”  wknews@inl.co.za   Weekend Argus
