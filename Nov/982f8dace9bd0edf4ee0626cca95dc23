London - With his distinctive dark hair and "Middleton eyes", Prince Louis is the spitting image of his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, when she was a baby. Even his "short back and sides" hairstyle seems to match his mother’s when she was photographed in her pram in 1982 before her first birthday. Little has been heard about Louis, now six months old, since he was born in late April, although Prince William has said he is a good sleeper who is adored by his big brother and sister. And he was exceptionally behaved throughout his christening in July. Royal watchers have been treated to just a handful of pictures of the fifth in line to the throne – on the steps of the Lindo Wing following his birth, at his baptism, and last week when a charming new photograph of him and Charles holding hands at the same photoshoot was released. But this week's delightful family portraits provide the best view of the chubby-cheeked prince so far, and what a beauty he is. So like his mother! Daily Mail
