DURBAN - A number of illegal vehicles were crushed today as part of a South African Revenue Service (SARS) clampdown on non-compliance in various sectors. This followed a high visibility two-day operation in Durban and surrounding areas to tackle illicit trade by a number of different authorities, including SARS, SAPS, Immigration, Cross Border Road Traffic Agency and Ethekwini Metro Police. The main focus of the operation was to clamp down on non-compliance relating to import/export of goods, smuggling of illegal substances and the illegal storage and movement of second hand goods. It included roadblocks in high risk areas, physical inspections of containers, cargo, bonded warehouses, patrols, vehicle checkpoints, gate checks and vessel rummages. Successes for the operation included :   With regard to the crushing of vehicles which took place at Phoenix this morning, a SARS statement said, “The importation of second hand imported vehicles is restricted into South Africa. Previously these vehicles were sold at Customs auction for export, but these vehicles invariably found their way back to SA. This obviously has an impact on the local vehicle manufacturing industry which contributes about 7.5% to the country’s GDP. This important industry is hugely impacted by the unfair competition imposed by the influx of second hand vehicles.” They added that 26 vehicles have been forfeited to the state this year with an estimated market value of almost R4 million.
