Johannesburg - A SAA flight from Cape Town to OR Tambo International Airport had to land at King Shaka International Airport due to a heavy storm in Johannesburg. About 130 passengers, including Minister Siyabonga Cwele and Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, and four SAA crew members were on board. The flight was meant to land at OR Tambo International Airport at 20:10. Captain Paul Weich told passengers that safety comes first. “Due to a heavy storm in OR Tambo, we can’t land. We are trying to land at Lanseria. If we can’t, we will have to land in Durban because the weather is good there.” Weich asked his crew and all passengers to sit down and fasten belts as the plane shook due to turbulence. Weich said “when the plan lands in Durban, have to get fuel and do new paper work. “What can I do. I hope we can get home safe,” said Cwele. Wynand Van Der Net, a Health Professions Council of South Africa moderator who was on the plane, said he trusted the SAA crew. “I was in Cape Town to moderate exams. I arrived on Tuesday. Well, safety comes first. We trust the crew with our lives hence I believe we will land safe in Durban. Of course, this has affected all of us. We are going to get home late.” More flights are expected to land in Durban. The Star
