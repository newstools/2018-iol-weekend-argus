Cape Town - The managing director of the Amy Foundation, Kevin Chaplin has hit back at social development MEC Albert Fritz over the closure of the NGO. On Thursday, Fritz said an oversight visit would be done at Amy Foundation's offices because he heard they had closed down. Fritz also said a forensic audit into the Foundation's finances would be done.  In a statement, managing director of the Amy Foundation, Kevin Chaplin said a decision to temporarily close the head office is a board and management decision "which we are authorised to do". "I am surprised that the MEC for Social Development, Albert Fritz wants to conduct a forensic audit into the Foundation. The department conducted an audit between 11th and 13th June 2018. While we welcome another audit, I don't believe it is the most prudent use of public funds to conduct two audits in five months. I strongly refute any implication that there is maladministration or a misappropriation of public funds. The audit will prove this," Chaplin said. He said the foundation did not infringe any contract with the department as there is no current contract in place. The last contract ended in March this year. "I am very happy to show the department that the reason for non-compliance was a direct result of outsourcing the compliance to NGOs who do not have the necessary bureaucratic competence to conduct the requirements timely and efficiently," said Chaplin. He said he had been "taken aback" by the change in sentiment towards the Foundation. "He visited the Foundation in May and was very impressed with our work. His department, in partnership with Impumelelo, awarded the Foundation the Ministerial Youth Excellence Award in 2016 and we were the runner-up in 2017," said Chaplin. The Foundation was founded by the parents of Amy Biehl, an American student killed during a protest in 1993. Weekend Argus
