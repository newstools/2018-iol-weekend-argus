 If there was a dress code for duchesses, both Kate and Meghan were sticking to it yesterday as they carried out separate public visits. They wore similar burgundy outfits, both had their hair in ponytails, while Meghan showed off a previously unseen ring spelling out the word ‘love’. The pair were making unannounced visits to projects in London, with Kate launching the latest phase of her work championing early intervention with vulnerable children to prevent problems in later life. She revealed that she had studied psychology while at St Andrews University, where she met husband Prince William. It is thought to be the first time she has spoken of studying the subject. ‘I started off doing psychology at St Andrews, with history of art,’ she said during her visit to the psychology and language sciences division at University College London. Kate was speaking at UCL’s developmental risk and resilience unit, where she met researchers led by co-director Professor Eamon McCrory to hear about the university’s ground-breaking research on how early experiences can shape brain function and social and emotional development. Earlier, her sister-in-law the Duchess of Sussex had met her friends in the Grenfell Tower community with whom she collaborated on a fund-raising cookbook following last year’s devastating fire. Meghan rolled up her sleeves and got cooking at the Hubb Community Kitchen in West London, her first visit there since her pregnancy was announced last month. © Daily Mail
