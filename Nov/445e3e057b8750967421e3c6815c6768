Born and bred in Belhar, in the Cape Flats, the R&B/soul musician will soon release her third album after a self-imposed exile from recording music. She took a break because she said she needed to “re-energise and to find renewed focus. I think it is important to take a break, just to settle, to get away from the hype of everybody telling you you’re amazing”. “Now I am preparing to record my album. I am busy rebranding myself, getting ready for the single release I am a crooner of note. I write all my music myself, arrange it all myself I am an all-rounder.” She released Say My Name to critical acclaim in 2007 and in 2012, By Request saw the light. Say My Name won a South African Music Award (Sama) and By Request was nominated for a Sama. Phillips, who started singing at a young age when she caught the attention of her teachers at Accordion Street Primary School in Belhar, ventured on to professional stages as a cover artist but soon chose to build her own brand and style. She completed her debut album in which she worked with producer and fellow Capetonian Patrick “Caramel” Hickey in 2006 under independent label, MOM. Her music offers a variation of jazz, funk, soul and folk.. Philips takes after her father who is a multi-instrumentalist who had two bands. “My dad always encouraged me to find my own voice and I did that. I was doing the whole cover thing, but I am an artist, not an impersonator,” she said. Phillips attended the performing arts school, Prompt. “I started singing jazz got into a band people enjoyed the way I sang the music of other people because I didn’t sing it like them.” Follow Claire on Twitter at @claire952, @clairephillips952 on Instagram, @clairephillipssa on Facecebook and access her music on soundcloud.com/Claire-phillips.
