Saunders, who shared a house with the family in Elsies River was a very good friend of Courtney's father Aaron Pieters. Her partially decomposed body was found on May 13, 2017 near a dumping site in Epping, nine days after the child disappeared from her home. Judge Mantame said the State had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that Saunders planned the rape and murder. “He bought the ant poison despite nobody who testified and who lived in the same house said there was any problem,” said Mantame in her 82-page judgment. She did not mince her word when she said Saunders not only lived with the family, was friends with the parents but more importantly, was in a position of trust and abused that trust when he poisoned, raped and killed the little girl.  She described the case as an “abominable” crime. “The accused had enough time to change his mind, instead he hid her body and helped the community search for her knowing what he did,” said Mantame. The judge once again reminded the court of the very graphic testimonies the court heard and the pain that the little girl must have suffered when she was poisoned, raped and strangled by Saunders. Pre-sentencing procedures will commence on December 4. Weekend Argus
