Johannesburg - The Gauteng South High Court has recognised Lerato Sengadi as late hip hop star HHP's customary wife and ruled that his funeral must proceed. Sengadi had applied for an urgent interdict to halt the funeral proceedings. In court papers, Sengadi said she was Tsambo's lawful wife and that the late rapper's father Robert Tsambo and/or those acting in his instruction must provide her with full details regarding the whereabouts of Tsambo's remains. Judge Ratha Mokgoathleng on Friday recognised Sengadi as HHP's wife but ruled that the funeral must proceed as HHP "was a national hero, and deserves a decent funeral".      He implored Sengadi to attend in the spirit of Ubuntu.      Sengadi approached the courts following a statement released by the Tsambo family spokesperson Nkululeko Ncana, stating that the family does not recognise Sengadi as the rapper’s widow. In her affidavit, Sengadi declared that she is the lawful customary wife to HHP, detailing the lobola negotiations and wedding ceremony that took place in February 2016. Sengadi stated that the family has alienated her, she only found out on social media that the Tsambo family will bury HHP in Mahikeng. Tsambo's father hit back at these claims, saying lobola negotiations between the two families were never concluded. Robert Tsambo said in court documents on Thursday that there was no "handover ceremony" to welcome Sengadi into the family, therefore, there was no customary marriage. IOL
