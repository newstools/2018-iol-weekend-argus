Cape Town - The ANC in the Cape Town council has dismissed the new Mayoral Committee as just being a front for the Democratic Alliance to "protect white privilege" and is composed of councillors who were "incapable" and lacked experience. And it warned that it would meet mayor Dan Plato "on the streets" because it didn't recognise him as he was not elected by citizens to the office.  The party's Chief Whip in the City of Cape Town, Noluthando Makasi, said the Mayco consisted of those who were rewarded for assisting the DA to push former mayor Patricia de Lille out of office. "It's embarrassing to note who has been selected for the positions in the Mayco as well as the mini-mayors. They will not serve the poor but will continue to work towards benefitting the affluent". Plato announced a new Mayco on Sunday, retaining some members including Safety and Security head JP Smith and Xanthea Limberg, who is responsible for Informal Settlement, Water and Sanitation He brought in new faces including Member of Parliament John Vos, councillor Patricia Purchase and Sharon Cottle. The leader of the party in the council, Xolani Sotashe, said Plato's legacy during his caretaker stint in 2009-2011 did not bode well for service delivery and building an inclusive city. "It was during that term that Blikkiesdorp was established as a temporary relocation area but is still in existence. The open toilets in Khayelitsha are also his legacy," he added. He said Plato should have cut the "bloated structure" by removing mini-mayors who had no executive authority to make decisions. Provincial leader Faiez Jacobs called on communities to "wake up" and realise that they were being "abused" by a party that seeks to protect the privilege of a few people. Weekend Argus
