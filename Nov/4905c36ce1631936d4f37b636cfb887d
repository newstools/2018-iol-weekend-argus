 HOW WE MET We met on Tinder. He swiped right and so did I. We met briefly in June 2016 and went on our official date two months later.  THE PROPOSAL AND WEDDING The proposal on a trip to the Maldives was amazing. He used my birthday as the excuse for the trip. He went down on one knee during a romantic dinner on the beach. The wedding was a traditional Tamil ceremony with 200 guests in attendance.  BIGGEST CHALLENGE Securing a booking for the wedding at the venue was a big challenge. The venue was confirmed a month before.  VIEWS ON LOVE AND MARRIAGE It is all about making the small moments matter. Compromise is key. Sunday Tribune Herald
