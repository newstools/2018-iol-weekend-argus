Actress Mandy Moore ditched the classic white wedding dress and chose the colour blush pink for her wedding. The 34-year-old star, exchanged vows with musician Taylor Goldsmith, 33, on Sunday at an intimate backyard ceremony. Moore, in an interview to people.com in August, said she won't be choosing "a stereotypical white wedding dress". She sported a stunning blush pink gown featuring a tiered tulle skirt, floral-embellished waist and high ruffled neckline, designed by Rodarte.

Moore's makeup artist, Jenn Streicher, posted photographs of the bride's breathtaking look, which were soon deleted, but reposted to a fan account.     What a magical day. I laughed, I cried and I danced real hard. @mandymooremm ❤️ @taylordawesgoldsmith. And that custom @rodarte dress was truly a dream.

Moore was previously married to musician Ryan Adams, though they split in 2015 after almost six years of marriage. This is Goldsmith's first marriage. Goldsmith was also filmed playing the piano at his own wedding.     Five minutes before walking down the aisle, this is where I find @taylordawesgoldsmith Congrats Taylor and @mandymooremm Love you both so deeply.
