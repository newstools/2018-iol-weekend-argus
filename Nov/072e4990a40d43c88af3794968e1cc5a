Pretoria - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday sent condolences to the government and people of Zimbabwe, following a horrific crash involving two buses which killed at least 47 people. “On behalf of the people of South Africa, we send our deepest condolences to the Zimbabwean government, particularly the families who lost their loved ones. Our prayers and thoughts are with you and we wish you strength during this time of grief”, said Ramaphosa. "We appeal to all [people] travelling between South Africa and Zimbabwe or our neighbouring countries to always exercise caution. Road carnages rob us of our breadwinners and delay our family developments”.
