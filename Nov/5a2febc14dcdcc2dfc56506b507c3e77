Durban - The shooter who gunned down two people inside the Durban Magistrate's Court on Monday morning has succumbed to his injuries. According to Kwazulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele the man, who was also a police officer, died in hospital. “An inquest will be investigated,” she said. Earlier in the day, the man entered Court O and fired out shots at his estranged wife and a man, who police said was the woman's brother. It is thought that the shooting stemmed from a domestic case between the shooter and the deceased woman. The shooter then turned the gun on himself and fired a shot. He was rushed to a local hospital for urgent care. Mbele then said police had opened two cases of murder. Speaking outside the court, Mbele said the two succumbed to their wounds and died at the scene. The Durban Magistrate's Court was on lockdown for most of Monday. Daily News
