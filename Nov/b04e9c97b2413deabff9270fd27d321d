The 2018 figures for Westville Boys’ High, Curro Hillcrest and Highbury are about double those of last year. “We are saddened by high levels of emigration within our parent body this year and the loss of wonderful boys who have enjoyed their years at Highbury,” said headmaster Roland Lacock. “Emigration levels have doubled versus last year, and last year there were twice as many as 2016.” At the end of this year, 11 Westville Boys’ High boys - compared with an average of six - will quit the school because they are leaving South Africa, said headmaster Trevor Hall. Nearby Hoërskool Port Natal said it had lost a number of teachers to emigration but not any significant number of pupils. New Zealand came up as the country to which most schools were losing pupils, followed by the UK and Australia. Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the US also featured. The issue of land expropriation without compensation was one of the main factors, according to emigration consultant Munyaradzi Nkomo of Strategies Migration Service SA.
