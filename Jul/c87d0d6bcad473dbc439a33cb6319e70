Cape Town - Eleven-year-old Marceline Spandiel from Ravensmead, who has been missing since July 10, has run away from home before, according to community pastor and family friend, Adam Alexander. Alexander said that Spandiel and her brother were living at a children's home in Stellenbosch prior to moving in with their grandmother who lives in Ravensmead. She had run away from the children's home in Stellenbosch before and returned shortly thereafter. “She ran away several times but she came home, but this time she didn't come home. “She ran away from a children's home in Stellenbosch because her brother ran away. She came to look for him and brought him back to the house. She's responsible like that. Her grandmother is very worried,” said Alexander. Spandiel was last seen in the company of her twin brother at the Belhar train station, and is believed to have gotten onto the train without him. She was wearing a blue long-sleeved shirt with grey tracksuit pants. Anyone with information is asked to contact Sergeant Dale Franks on 072 145 4163. @IamAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
