    Flashback. Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. Is it a virtue? Definitely yes but also a skill. Patience keeps us grounded and rational. Patience lets us be loving and forgiving. Patience give us hope, faith and willingness.âœ¨ #practicingpatience #gratitude #happytuesday A post shared by  Dr Nandipha (@nanzyee) on May 22, 2018 at 2:58am PDT
