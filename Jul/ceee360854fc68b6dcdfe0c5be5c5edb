MEC Donald Grant said that the report, which examines the fatal taxi violence incidents in Langa and Delft and was slated for release yesterday following a week’s delay, required “proper analysis”. When questioned on the findings and when the report would be released, Grant said: “It’s going to take longer than we thought. "We are going to wait for a proper analysis. It’s a question of the report being balanced. I’m looking for a sustainable solution.” The report is headed by a department registrar, which comprises two advocates. Grant referred the Weekend Argus to his spokesperson Siphesihle Dube, who said the MEC would release the report when he has it in his possession. He didn't respond to a request for an updated comment. Speaking from Abu Dhabi yesterday, Police Minister Bheki Cele confirmed he was due to meet Cape Town taxi bosses in a follow-up meeting. Following reported allegations of route invasions and illegal operators, among others, at least 15 drivers were killed in a wave of shootings in the taxi industry in the region this year alone. Some of the shootings took place in Nyanga, Khayelitsha and Wynberg. Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association provincial chairperson, Victor Wiwi, said they were awaiting the MEC’s feedback. Spokesperson for the Congress of Democratic Taxi Associations, Besuthu Ndungane, said the department had not communicated anything to their organisation relating to the report.
