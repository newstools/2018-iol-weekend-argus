Anyone who knows a little about Cape Town will tell you it’s arguably the creative capital of South Africa. After it was named a Unesco City of Design in 2017, it’s no wonder artists from everywhere flock to the Mother City. They seek opportunity, creative energy and work. Whether they’re searching for fashion and film, or if they want to make music, paint, act or dance, chances are they’ll find it in Cape Town. But with the city's high property prices and the huge demand to live here, some creatives are battling to find a place to live.

They give us the inside scoop into what daily life at a back-packers is like as well as the pros and cons of couch-surfing and house-sitting. Read their story here.   Like us on Facebook
