Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said the incident was being investigated. “Circumstances surrounding a shooting incident that occurred at Somerset West in the early hours of Friday morning are under investigation. Cases of house robbery and a death inquest were opened for investigation after an intruder, who was shot and wounded, died,” she said. Rwexana said the alleged burglar was yet to be identified and no arrests had been made at this stage. Somerset West CPF spokesperson Billy Smith said the incident, which occurred in Kirkia Street, was unfortunate. “The intruder gained access into the woman’s home while she was alone with her daughter. After seeing him she fired a shot. She then hit the burglar with a blunt force and
it’s understood she hit an artery. “The burglar then bled to death,” Smith said. Smith said the woman’s husband was travelling at the time and he confirmed the area in which the crime occurred is a hot spot for property-related crimes. “It is unfortunate that people have to defend themselves to this extent, but we live in such a time where it is necessary to protect your family. “The public is frustrated with crime levels and is doing what they can to protect them from becoming victims. “Because the woman was home alone she had to do 
what was needed to defend herself and her daughter,” Smith said. Cape Times
