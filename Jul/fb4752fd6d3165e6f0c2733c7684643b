The billionaire’s companies could assist by trying to pinpoint the boys’ location using Space Exploration Technologies or Boring technology, pumping water or providing heavy duty battery packs known as Tesla Powerwalls, a spokesman for Musk said. The Thai government confirmed in a statement posted on Facebook that Musk’s team was due to arrive yesterday. The 12 boys and their coach were found by a pair of British cave divers on Monday. Efforts to rescue them are being hampered by narrow passageways and rising water in the cave system. Most of the boys cannot swim. A former Thai navy Seal died on Friday in an underwater rescue attempt. Last year, after a devastating hurricane hit Puerto Rico, the government there asked Musk for help. Tesla sent Powerwalls and provided advice on rebuilding the Caribbean island’s infrastructure. Over the past few days, Musk posited ways his companies could help in Thailand. “I suspect the Thai govt has this under control, but am happy to help if there is a way to do so,” he wrote on Twitter. Musk’s tunnelling start-up Boring could make available its massive drills or excavation expertise but such an approach could be too dangerous. - The Washington Post
