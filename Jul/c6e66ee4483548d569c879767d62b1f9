Fredie Blom is no ordinary man. At 114, he is possibly older than any of South Africa’s 56 million and possibly the oldest man alive, subject to confirmation by the Guinness World Records. Sitting quietly in his favourite spot in the courtyard of his house in Delft, Blom looked up to acknowledge visitors. “I would love to have a conversation, but these days I can hardly hear people when they speak,” he said with a smile. Blom’s house resembles any other on the Cape Flats - tiny, with only two bedrooms - but it has had a few additions which he proudly pointed out as the “work of my own hands”. The walls are adorned with posters of Bible verses, framed photos of him and his 85 year-old wife, Jeanette, and miniature porcelain dolls and ornaments. Apart from using a cane when he walks, Blom is fit, strong and sharp-eyed. He’s never seen a doctor for treatment and as a centenarian belongs to an elite club of a few worldwide. In a country which has a high rate of lifestyle-associated diseases, the life expectancy rate for males is 65 years and for females, 71. Blom still takes walks around the neighbourhood, makes himself a cup of coffee and a glass of herbs in water every morning. He remembers his parents as being “humble and kind” and doesn’t know if any of his siblings are still alive. Born two years after the end of the Second Anglo-Boer War in the small farming town of Adelaide, Blom moved to Cape Town. But he would soon be affected by the Group Areas Act. “We first lived in what is now known as Philippi, then we moved to Ottery before we were forcibly moved to Delft. In Ottery we lived in a huge house, so Fredie was upset when we were moved here - the house was tiny and he kept referring to the house as a pondotjie. But we gradually settled in,” said Jeanette. Blom remembers the end of apartheid and the setting in of a new dawn in South Africa when Nelson Mandela was elected the first democratic president in 1994.
