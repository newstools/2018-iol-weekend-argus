Cape Town - A year ago, the dams supplying the Western Cape with water were at a staggering 26%, and by the end of April, just 18% remained. Now, the Western Cape Government has announced that the dam levels have reached, and surpassed, 50% The dams feeding the City of Cape Town were at a collective 56%. Local government, environmental affairs and development planning MEC for the Western Cape Anton Bredell said the rainfall this winter season had provided much needed relief. “We have received a lot of water. That, along with the province’s augmentation work over the past three years and the public’s efforts to conserve water has seen us through a very dry period. We want to thank each and every person who has played a part in managing this drought.” Now was not the time to rest on our laurels, Bredell said. “We are breathing slightly easier but we must make it clear that we are not out of the woods yet. For one thing, 50% is not 100% or even 80% and we are heading to a summer season where demand will increase again rapidly. In addition, the situation in the Gouritz River Catchment area remains serious.” Bredell said weather forecasters are indicating some additional rainfall for July, August and September but with very little confidence in the forecast which means there is a small likelihood of more good rains to come. “Given the present situation in water levels of our dams and the continued long term winter outlook, we continue to urge the public to do as much as possible to conserve water. In fact we are urging that the behaviour change we have seen with water usage, must become long term and permanent moving forward.” @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
