INTERNATIONAL - Samsung is reportedly planning to release a two-in-one charger for its smartphones and the upcoming Galaxy Watch reportedly coming alongside the Galaxy Note 9.      Packaging for the Wireless Charger Duo has leaked ahead of Samsung’s Unpacked press conference, which will be held at Barclays Center on August 9th according to a report by the Verge. According to the leak, the Wireless Charger Duo box reveals that it’s capable of charging either two Qi-compatible phones simultaneously or one phone and the Galaxy Watch. Both placement areas support fast wireless charging. The upcoming Note 9 is rumored to feature a 4,000mAh battery, and Samsung has registered a new wireless charger that could improve upon the already-fast wireless recharge capabilities of recent Galaxy smartphones. Rumors for the Samsung Gear S4 state that the company may offer the upcoming watch in two different sizes. According to Samsung blog SamMobile, the company plans to range two sizes and this may be to offer a more appropriate choice for those who have smaller wrists and therefore like smaller watches. Samsung Gear S4 is rumored to be getting a 470mAh battery. It’s not yet clear whether the Wireless Charger Duo will be capable of that higher output.
