CAPE TOWN - Telkom has launched a 1GB WhatsApp bundle for R15, where the data lasts for 30 days and can only be used on the messaging platform. " Telkom has launched a R15 WhatsApp bundle for a limited timeframe only via Mo’ Nice using *123# USSD. We run promotions on the Mo’Nice platform on a continuous basis. The WhatsApp bundle was launched on Thursday 5 July as a special offer which may be repeated from time to time", said Telkom. The new WhatsApp data bundle is available through the *123# USSD menu by selecting option 2. While Telkom’s WhatsApp product will be attractive to certain Telkom subscribers, it is not the best deal available in South Africa. MTN offers the same product for R10, making Telkom’s 1GB WhatsApp data bundle is more expensive. It does, however, offer better value for money than Cell C’s 30-day WhatsApp bundle. Cell's bundle costs R15, but only allows for 600MB data use. Unfortunately, Vodacom does not have any WhatsApp bundle deals available. In other Telkom deals, Telkom announced its Big Deal for July 2018 on the first of the month, offering users two uncapped LTE packages. The deals for July are: 1. Uncapped LTE Business Hours – R599 pm x 24 2. Uncapped LTE All Hours – R899 pm x 24 According to Telkom, for the “Business Hours” package users will receive uncapped LTE services between midnight and 17:00 each day. The “All Hours” package provides users with uncapped LTE for 24 hours a day. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
