Durban - Rubber necking motorists and employees at nearby businesses watched smoke billow out of the back of a cash in transit vehicle on Wednesday. The Durban fire department is trying to establish the cause of a fire onboard a cash in transit vehicle in Mathews Meyiwa (Stamford Hill) Road. Firefighters are still on scene. Members of the public initially thought the vehicle as set alight by robbers because the vehicle was parked in the centre of the road with the doors open. It is alleged that the vehicle had experienced electrical problems. No further details of the incident were made available to the media and if any money was onboard the vehicle. The Durban Fire department said firemen were still compiling a report of the incident.  The fire comes barely a month after the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) called for CIT companies to protect guards against criminal syndicates and organised criminals. Fedusa welcomed the Motor Transport Workers Union's (MTWU) urgent meeting with the management of the major CIT companies Fidelity Cash Services, G4S Cash Solutions and SBV,  said Dennis George, Fedusa General Secretary. George said the leadership of Fedusa and MTWU has identified several weaknesses in the safety and security of the CIT industry including weak and out-dated vehicle design. Daily News
