Cape Town - There are concerns Ravensmead girl Marceline Spandiel could become another in a long line of horror stories of young children going missing on the Cape Flats, only to be found dead. The 11-year-old girl was last seen on July 10, at Belhar train station, where it is believed she tried to get her twin brother to get onto a train with her. When he refused, she left him on the platform. When the family was approached on Tuesday, the twins' grandmother Cathy Martin, said the children were to be in her care until September 19, as they were between fosters homes. While Marceline had run away from home before - mostly to retrieve her truant twin brother - she would always return, and a close family friend and pastor Adam Alexander said the family was concerned as she had not been seen for two weeks. Her disappearance has stirred up bitter memories of Courtney Pieters, 3, who went missing eight days before her broken body was found kilometres from her home. Five-year-old Minentle Lekhata was reportedly the 21st girl to have been murdered in the Western Cape this year alone. There was also little Iyapha Yamile, 4, who was raped and murdered. Stacey Adams's alleged killer Christopher Brown is standing trial for her rape and murder. The 6-year-old Eastridge girl's body was found in a shallow grave. Thousands of people attended the 2017 funeral of 11-year-old Stacha Arendse. Her body was discovered days after she had gone missing. Rene Tracy Roman, 13, left her home to buy a packet of chips at a tuckshop a few doors away from her home, in March 2017. Her body was found in a nearby wendy house 11 days later. @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
