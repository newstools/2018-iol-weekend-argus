Johannesburg - The Alexandra, Randburg, Midrand and Sandton Taxi Association (Armsta) on Friday confirmed that its chairperson and one other member were shot dead in Marlboro, Sandton. Armsta spokesperson John Mnisi said on Thursday Themba Sam Budza and member Fani Ramatfwane were gunned down while travelling homeÂ from a meeting under police escort. "We don't know what the motive is of the shooting, my understanding was that two cars came and started shooting at them and the police were there but they didn't do anything," said Mnisi. A third taxi association member survived the shooting and was recovering in hospital. Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela confirmed the shooting. "Two people were shot dead in Marlboro but we don't know the suspects and also the motive of the shooting," said Makhubela. "It remains unclear if this was taxi violence or pure crime. "Murder and attempted murder cases had been opened." Police are investigating two cases of murder and one of attempted murder. African News Agency/ANA
