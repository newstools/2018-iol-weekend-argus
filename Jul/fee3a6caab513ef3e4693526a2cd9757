The new party, Mazibuye African Congress, promises to champion the cause of black people, with its leaders saying the membership will not be open to white South Africans. Indians could join the party but would not be able to hold any positions even in the lower structures, one of its leaders said, while maintaining the party was not at all racist. “Our legal team is fine-tuning the party's constitution so that it is in line with that of the country,” the party's president, Reggie Ngcobo said. He is a former ANC member turned EFF activist and so is Nathi Phewa, the party's secretary-general. Ngcobo said: “Those who think we are opportunists are within their rights to think like that.” Ngcobo admitted there were “too many” political parties already in the country but said his party entered the space because that is the only way to correct the ills of politicians. The leaders of the new political party sought advice from Zuma but Ngcobo said there was nothing sinister in this. “We have no links with president Jacob Zuma. In fact we tried to even meet former president Thabo Mbeki but we were told that his diary is full,” he said. Ngcobo said the party will support Zuma in his corruption trial. THE MERCURY
