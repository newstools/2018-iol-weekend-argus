Minnie Dlamini and hubby Quinton Jones rocked up at the Vodacom Durban July on Saturday dressed to the nines. The pair, dressed by Gert Johan, wore matching outfits designed especially to celebrate the July and Minnie's birthday.  She said she wanted to do the opposite of the actual black movement that's currently happening. "Lets look at the bright side. Let's celebrate all the good that's happening," said Dlamini. The couple will celebrate Minnie's birthday at a 47th Avenue on Saturday night.

But Mrs and Mrs Jones were not the only celebrities who pulled out all the stops for the VDJ. Here are some of favourite celeb looks.     Fiancés looking hot. Happy times.
