The event, hosted by 400m Olympic champion Wayde van Niekerk and Springbok captain Siya Kolisi drew sports stars, local celebrities, musicians and politicians from all over the country. DA leader Mmusi Maimane also supported the fund-raiser, which hoped to raise R500000 for the Newborns Groote Schuur Trust. Tickets for the exclusive gathering sold for R1000 a head and several items will be auctioned to raise funds. Musician Arno Carstens was the headline act for the fund-raising gala. Van Niekerk himself was a premature baby and said the issue is a very personal one for him. Event organisers said they invited their very best donors and hoped that people would dig deep for this cause. On the back of this event, South Africans have been asked to boost Kolisi’s bid to be entered in the Laureus Sport Awards Magic moments. To support Kolisi, who is in second place, the public is encouraged to visit the Laureus website. Items on auction include a pair of running spikes signed by Van Niekerk and Kolisi’s debut Bok captain jersey. The MC for the event was South African comedian Riaad Moosa. Funds are being raised for the Groote Schuur Trust. The neonatal unit at the hospital was started in 2007. Refurbishments are under way and although Groote Schuur Hospital funds the Newborns Trust, the neonatal unit has to compete with many other units. Premature babies need high care at a cost of R390 an hour and sometimes the babies need to stay for three months. One in every eight babies are born prematurely in the Western Cape. Van Niekerk was born at 29 weeks, eight weeks too soon. Organisers say the event is a prelude to Preemie Month, which is in November. Van Niekerk and Kolisi, speaking via their publicist, said the event was held during Mandela Month as their contribution.
