CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town said on Thursday it was spending more than R3 million on upgrades of the Strandfontein fishing spot along the False Bay coast. The City said the area situated close to Strandfontein Pavilion has been in the spotlight on several occasions as a result of erosion to the infrastructure caused by spring tides and wave action. In October 2017, a report on remedial action was submitted to the City’s Coastal Transversal Working Group. Just more than six months later, in May 2018, a contractor moved onto the site to start a nine-week project aimed at restoring the infrastructure and preventing future damage. Assisted by four local labourers, the contractor has thus far removed all the existing asphalt layers and subbase materials and started constructing a gabion retaining wall, working in 20-metre sections at a time. Other aspects of the construction that is planned includes excavating and reinstalling the parking area edge and diverting the sewer line underneath the parking area.  The project is funded by the City’s Recreation and Parks department as the facility owner, in partnership with the City’s Coastal Management department who designed the engineering solution.  “I was very impressed by what I saw during a recent site visit, both in terms of the work being done to address this long-standing issue, but also with the rate of progress of the contractor. It is our hope that the fishing fraternity will find the upgrades and reinforcements a step up from the challenges that they’ve had to contend with in the past,” said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith. “I also urge fishermen using the facility to please desist from driving over the dunes, but instead to use only the path leading out of the parking area to get to their fishing spot.” African News Agency (ANA)
