The Sunday Sun has reported that Somizi Mhlongo's fianc√©, Mohale Motaung has been getting up close and personal with another man. According to the newspaper article, Mohale was seen cosying up to a young man, whom they have identified as Vuyo Pan, during his 24th birthday dinner in Fourways, North of Johannesburg, two weeks ago. Mohale's party was held at the Palazzo Hotel and Somizi, who is 21 years Mohale's senior, was not in attendance. Sources went on record to say that it was Mohale who reportedly made the first move and had set up meetings with the 19-year-old Vuyo that were said to be about business and work opportunities. After being informed of his fiance's doings, Somizi alledged sent Vuyo a threatening text message. The paper stateed that Vuyo himself also confirmed this, saying "Mohale invited me to dinner and my fiance of three years dropped me off there. I was shocked to find out that Somizi wasn't there. After the dinner with his other friends, I started getting threatening messages from Somizi." Vuyo went on to add that he has stopped contacting Mohale and does not understand why he is being attacked when he is not the one making the moves. Neither Somizi or Mohale have directly commented. However, the Idols SA judge took to Instagram on Sunday, posting a photo of himself and his partner, with a caption: "AND THEN WHAT? NIT VIR DIE DING. HAMONATE JWANG. By the great ROSALIA".
