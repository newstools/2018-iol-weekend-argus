The year's Vodacom Durban July had more fashion misses than hits and two of Mzansi's favourite shock jocks Zodwa Wabantu and Skolopad both had a "who wore it" a better moment at the Greyville Racecourse on Saturday. Wabantu confirmed beforehand that she would be performing at two marques, while Skolopad admitted that she was doing the Durban July on a budget. What had the Twitter streets talking was that both entertainers outfits were very similar to two big international style icons. Skolopad wore a simple floor length dress with flower appliques at the bust which was very similar to a dress Rihanna wore to amFar in 2014.      While Wabantu wore a sheer black dress with revealing cutouts which looked similar to a dress Jennifer Lopez wore.     Who Wore it best?
