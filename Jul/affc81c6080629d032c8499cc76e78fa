Durban - Shocking details have emerged in the bail application of a Verulam man who is charged with raping his stepdaughter over a five year period. In court on Tuesday, it was claimed that the man allegedly raped his stepdaughter 900 times. The 43-year-old mechanic is applying for bail at the Verulam Family Court. State prosecutor, San Bharto, told Magistrate Irfan Khalil that in a four-hour interview with the 10-year-old girl, she claimed her stepfather raped her every second day which amounted to 900 counts of rape between 2013 to 2018.      It is alleged that since his wife passed away in 2013, he had been sexually abusing the child who was 5 years old at the time. Allegations include that he made her watch porn, and also used a vibrator on the little girl. The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child, is facing charges including counts of rape, sexual grooming of a child, sexual assault, exposure of pornography to a child, and grievous bodily harm. He allegedly masturbated in front of the child. In the dock, he questioned the credibility of his stepdaughter as a witness. It emerged in court that the accused has three children, a 16-year-old, a five-year-old and the 10-year-old victim. Defence attorney Mondli Mthethwa said his client was adamant to apply for bail and did not fear his safety. But outside court, protesters could be heard chanting “no bail”. In his affidavit the accused denied all allegations against him including rape and sexual assault. “The State has fabricated the case against me. There is no DNA evidence to prove the claims,” he said through his defence. The man was arrested last month when police swooped in on his home after the little girl, who had allegedly been locked up in a small shack, escaped and raised the alarm with neighbours. The bail application is still under way on Tuesday morning. The case was briefly adjourned for the defence to verify whether the accused had pending matters against him. Daily News
