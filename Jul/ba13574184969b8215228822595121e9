Cape Town - The Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) has slammed the recent attacks on its rolling stock and infrastructure. There have been at least seven attacks in six weeks in which trains were torched by suspected arsonists, and infrastructure damaged and stolen by vandals. "Between the 21st July 2018 and the 28th July 2018, three senseless incidents of burnings of PRASA trains caused millions of rand of damages to the PRASA rolling stock and network," Prasa's Board of Control said. "All these happened in Cape Town. It is clear to us that this is the work of people who have placed themselves as enemies of PRASA, enemies of our commuters and enemies of the South African Government. "No stone will be left unturned to find those who are responsible for this senseless malicious damage to property. The target will not only be the foot soldiers who carry out these crimes but also those who command them and stand to benefit from these criminal acts. "These saboteurs are present in our communities, they are our neighbours and our relatives who have taken a stance against us. Protecting our commuters and assets is part of our duty as a democratic state to stem lawlessness and impunity. "The Board and management of PRASA are working very hard to ensure that we recover our rolling stock and network for the good of our commuters and our our economy. We are working to return the service to one that is safe, available, reliable and on time. This is our commitment to the South African public. Our commitment and resolve in this regard will not be hampered by senseless acts of violence against our rolling stock and network meant to feed the gluttony of a few. "We call on our communities to stand with us in this battle and regain our assets and use our resources for delivering a service that our commuters deserve," it said. @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
