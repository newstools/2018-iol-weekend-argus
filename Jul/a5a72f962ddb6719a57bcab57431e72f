CAPE TOWN - WhatsApp announced it will now let you know when someone has forwarded a message to you. “WhatsApp cares deeply about your safety,” the company said in a blog post. “We encourage you to think before sharing messages that were forwarded.” The “forwarded” label will apply to all text, image, audio, and video messages forwarded to users. This new label feature was added in line with the social platform stopping the spread of misinformation and spam and to help users determine whether a message was actually written by a contact. The company said that they are looking for help from researchers to solve the problem of fake news on its platform. The company is offering a set of competitive awards to researchers interested in exploring issues related to misinformation on WhatsApp. “The WhatsApp Research Awards will provide funding for independent research proposals that are designed to be shared with WhatsApp and Facebook,” said WhatsApp. Follow us on our new Instagram page HERE! - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
