You can disrespect me kodwa Angizalwa e South Beach. I have Flats there wena unani making fun of me", which loosely translates to "I have the land, so the bed bugs can go to another man's house".

I have Flats there😂😂😂😂 wena unani🤷 making fun of me😎 A post shared by  zodwalibram (@zodwalibram) on Jul 15, 2018 at 3:17am PDT Speaking to Drum Magazine, Wabantu said that the land she bought in the Ehlanzeni District is purely for business purposes. “I have already bought land that I will live on. This land is for pushing my business, I’ll see whether I open a shisanyama, theatre or a cinema. I’ll see what I’ll do on the land, maybe I could even open a supermarket." The vosho queen explained that she bought the property in South Beach, Durban as means to make extra income. “I opened the flats and rented them out to students as a student accommodation. This creates profit for me." “For example, if I get to Durban and I get a two bedroom apartment, I will lease it for R4200 and get nine students who’ll pay R1000 each to stay in the apartment. From that R9000, I’ll pay the R4200 for the lease and get the rest of the money as profit,” she said.
