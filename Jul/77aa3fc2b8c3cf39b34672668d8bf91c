Cape Town - While the pace at which the dams are filling up in the Western Cape has been steady, it is nowhere the levels needed to scrap water restrictions. The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) met with the water users and municipalities who are supplied by the Western Cape water supply system to discuss the water restrictions. Rashid Khan, the DWS Western Cape Regional Head says while the pace in which the dams are replenishing is encouraging DWS is no near 85% where the restriction can be lifted as per the gazette of October 2017 and January 2018. “Although the system’s storage has recovered over the past weeks rainfall trends for this season still do not show that we have received above average amounts cumulatively,” Khan said. According to the latest dam levels assessment of 16 July 2018, the combined average dam levels for the Western Cape dams are at 54.75% as compared to 53.05% last week. Theewaterskloof Dam, the largest dam in the system has risen to 40.31% compared to 20.32% same time last year, Khan said. “During the meeting water users deliberated the water restrictions imposed as promulgated by the National Government. DWS will meet the water users at the end of August to re-assess the situation. The current water restrictions will remain as it is until the next meeting with water users in August. The rainfall trend up to that date will show the increase or decrease in the management of the water restrictions,” he said.  argusnews@inl.co.za  @TheCapeArgus Cape Argus
