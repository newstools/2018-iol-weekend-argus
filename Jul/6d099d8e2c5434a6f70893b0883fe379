Kim Kardashian West lets her daughter North have her hair straightened twice a year. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star - who also has two-year-old Saint and Chicago, six months, with her husband Kanye West - responded to a concerned follower on social media who warned the reality star about the damage the styling could do to her five-year-old daughter's naturally curly locks. Referring to a picture of her girl posing with dad Kanye, she responded: "She is allowed twice a year, on her birthday and birthday party! This pic was taken back in June on her bday (sic)"     I can still feel the love ðŸ’• A post shared by  Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jul 24, 2018 at 7:39am PDT For North's birthday last month, she had a joint unicorn-themed bash with her cousin Penelope Disick - the daughter of Kim's sister Kourtney Kardashian and her former partner Scott Disick - which even involved putting magical horns on Shetland ponies. The lavish party also saw a huge table of food complete with two unicorn cakes surrounded by delicious treats like donuts, cookies and ice cream. The doting mother likes to treat North, and she recently revealed her eldest child is "obsessed" with Disney Channel show The Cheetah Girls - which starred someone who is still very close to the Kardashian family. Tagging Adrienne Bailon, who played Chanel in the TV show and movies, Kim wrote: "North's new obsession! #CheetahGirls ... Should I break the news to North that this could have been her auntie?!?!?!" Adrienne - who previously dated Kim's brother Rob Kardashian - responded to Kim's story, quipping back: "Just woke up to this! LOL. This hairstyle and this outfit. HYSTERICAL. CHEETAHLICIOUS (sic)"
