Cape Town - Broken down vehicles, faulty traffic lights and crashes - these are the reasons many of Cape Town's road users spent at least an hour extra sitting in traffic on Monday morning. In a social media poll, 43% of respondents said it took at least an extra hour to get into work on Monday, with 19% spending at least 90 minutes extra, and the remaining 38% spent an extra two hours on the road.      "Would probably have been an extra hour if I didn't take another route to avoid the N1 issue. Absolutely ridiculous!" said Twitter user @SimKel16.      "With or without accident CT traffic is a nightmare, @CityofCT does nothing to alleviate this, it's 2018 and no innovation and no out of the box thinking, damn but the city works for u and claiming to be world class, for who? Tourists? As it's not world class for us!" tweeted Charl Cupido.      Other users slammed the slow response of city officials to a bus that was broken down along FW De Klerk Boulevard.      "This traffic in CT is just ridiculous. 3 HOURS to clear a bus stuck in the middle lane in one of the busiest roads in CT?!?ðŸ˜¡" said Michael Jacobs.      @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
