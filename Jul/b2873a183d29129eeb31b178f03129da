Appearing on the radio show last week, the host of the show Sway lists his favourite comedians and when he mentions Trevor Noah, Peters said:  "Why? If you're a fan of me you don't need to be a fan of Trevor Noah. Thieving motherf***er". WATCH: Trevor Noah speaks to CNN about 'End of Days' The 'Chef' star went on to explain that he previously called 'The Daily Show' host out for stealing his jokes, but he ended up doing it again. Peters then provided an example of a Russian joke which he claims Noah stole.   After playing both skits, Sway agreed there are similarities. Peters then explained the origin of the joke: his Russian fiancée was speaking to her mother over there phone in her native language and when she hung up, Peters jokingly mocked their conversation by speaking 'Russian gibberish'. To which his fiancée replied: "you're speaking in reverse". Noah has a similar joke, where he compares the Russian to a DJ scratching on a turntable. Peters also mentions one of the other bits that he claims Noah stole and mentioned that when he toured in South Africa Noah opened for him. Noah has not responded to Peters' claims as of yet.
