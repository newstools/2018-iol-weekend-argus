The SA Weather Service has warned that a strong cold front is making its way through the country. Forecaster Wisani Maluleke said the cold front was likely to reach KwaZulu-Natal late on Monday. “It will be warm during the day, but the effects of the cold front will be felt in the late afternoon, early evening,” Maluleke said. He said there would be a 30% chance of rainfall. “Temperatures are expected to drop from tomorrow in KZN and maximum temperatures will be very low. There will be strong winds along the coast reaching up to 35 knots,” he said. “(On Tuesday) temperatures in Durban could reach a low of 18°C, Ladysmith 12°C and the Drakensberg could be as low as 10°C,” said Maluleke. He said the Drakensberg would be very cold and experience light snow but “it will not be disruptive”. Mountainous areas would also experience colder temperatures than areas along the coast. “Cold temperatures will not last long as temperatures along the coast will start recovering from Wednesday,” he said. According to Snow Report SA, the cold front arrived in the Western Cape on Sunday and as it moved east, the Eastern Cape, Lesotho and KZN would receive their fair share of snowfall. “Extremely cold temperatures are expected right across the country with this front, and we are expecting the weather service to issue warnings in this regard. Farmers should take note of the warnings and take the necessary precautions, especially with regards to livestock. “Cross fingers, hold thumbs and put the heater on, folks, it’s going to be a COLD one! We will keep an eye on this system, and will update again if there are significant changes to the forecast,” Snow Report SA said. Daily News
