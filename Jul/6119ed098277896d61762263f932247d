DURBAN - EAST Coast Radio executives are hopeful their breakfast hosts Darren Maule and Keri Miller will report to work on Wednesday after an alleged spat between the two led to an on-air walkout. Miller walked out after getting entangled in an on-air argument with Maule. She apparently cried during the incident. Some on social media were left upset by the incident and posted messages to East Coast Radio expressing disatisfaction. Zane Derbyshire, East Coast Radio’s programming manager, said they had reviewed the audio and were currently speaking to both Maule and Miller in the hope that the two could make amends. “Darren and Keri are always taking jabs at each other and this morning Keri felt Darren took it too far and left the studio. We encourage our presenters to be their true selves at all times and that may result in conversations getting a little heated between the team sometimes,” said Derbyshire. Derbyshire said he hoped both would report to work on Wednesday morning and said neither of the two had expressed that they would not be coming to work. He also revealed that no action would be taken against Maule. “We have reviewed the audio and have not found anything that compromises the station or the show. No remedial action is necessary and we trust that Darren and Keri, who are currently chatting, will resolve the issue in a mutually satisfactory manner. “We firmly support and believe in Darren and Keri as the hosts of the East Coast Breakfast show and would kindly request that listeners allow them the space to resolve the issue this afternoon,” said Derbyshire. On social media however, some ECR listeners described the incident as bullying.   Another Facebooker applauded Miller for walking out.     DAILY NEWS
