Cape Town - A lack of reliable public transport has been cited as the main reason Cape Town's traffic is so bad. Cape Town is the most congested city in South Africa. On Monday morning, road users endured extra delays of between one and two hours, depending on which route they took into the Cape Town CBD. A social media poll showed the majority of respondents, 42 percent, felt the lack of reliable transport was to blame for the congested roads. The fact that for the most part, most of the road users were heading into the CBD using the handful of routes into the city also played a role.      29 percent of respondents felt the fact that there were no alternative routes into town was to blame. Respondents also had the option of "lack of traffic policing" and "bad road user habits".      "Difficult to stay ahead, when our trains are vandalised and ablaze! #Lawlessness #Criminality" tweeted user @CayForWater.      Curwin Samuels replied to the poll by saying: "You need an all of the above option..."      @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
