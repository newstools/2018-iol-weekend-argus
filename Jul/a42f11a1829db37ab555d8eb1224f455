Cape Town - The recent warm weather in the Western Cape has pushed Cape Town's water consumption up by 36 million litres a day, to 530 million litres of collective consumption. This is 80 million litres above the City of Cape Town's target of 450 million litres of collective consumption. Average dam levels of the city's supply reservoirs were at 56.4%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points, the city said. The City of Cape Town has urged residents to continue their savings efforts in a bid to build up a buffer ahead of the long, dry summer. "Although concerted water-saving efforts by the City and residents are still visibly under way, the influence of a warm week and an especially hot and windy weekend can clearly be seen in the water consumption data for the past week," the City said. "On Friday 20 July 2018, City officials, as well as officials from other municipalities and representatives from the agricultural sector, met with the National Department of Water and Sanitation to have a risk-based discussion on the water situation in the Western Cape. The meeting also considered the possible relaxation of water restrictions at an appropriate point in the near future," it said. "During the meeting, it was agreed that there would be a phased approach to the recovery of the dams," deputy mayor Ian Neilson said. "This means that there would not be a big shift in restriction levels in one step. "Due to the lack of rainfall over the past two weeks and the lower prospects over the coming weeks, it was decided that it was not appropriate to relax restrictions yet. The situation will again be assessed in August," he said. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
