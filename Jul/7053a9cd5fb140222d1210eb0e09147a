Mayor Patricia de Lille and the DA have reached an agreement regarding her disciplinary process going forward. “Both parties have agreed to a speedy disciplinary process, including a hearing that will take place over three days in August,” national spokesperson Solly Malatsi said. “In line with the agreement, the motion of no confidence against De Lille that was scheduled to take place on Thursday has been withdrawn. "In addition, the agreement makes space for the mayor to be held accountable in a fair and reasonable manner for findings of independent, council-led investigations such as the upcoming Bowman’s report into her conduct." Malatsi said, on De Lille’s insistence, the party will appoint a federal legal commission panel, and the prosecution will be led by an independent senior prosecutor and be open to the media. "This agreement states that we will all strive to conclude the matter as soon as possible. We are working to ensure that the DA caucus, the mayoral committee and functions of the City are focused on putting the people of Cape Town first,” he said.
