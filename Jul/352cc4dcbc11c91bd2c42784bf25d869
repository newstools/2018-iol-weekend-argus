Cape Town - While there has been some good rain and the recent snowfalls and subsequent melts have helped recharge the Western Cape's dams, the overall precipitation has been more or less average, according to the SA Weather Service (Saws). The past few years have been marked by below-average rainfall in the Western Cape, leading to the implementation of water restrictions and a tariff hike for the City of Cape Town, as a result of the water crisis. While Day Zero - the day when the taps in the Mother City would be turned off and run dry - has been pushed back a few years, restrictions remain in place with dams across the province only half full, with winter soon coming to an end. "We have more-or-less received the climatological average," Saws told the Cape Argus when asked about ten-year means. While the Western Cape Government had said there would be good rains for the rest of July, and in the coming months of August and September, Saws said it was unable to quantify the amount of rain in millimetres that would fall over those months. "(We) cannot quantify that in terms of mm as we give a 7 day forecast, and the seasonal forecast looks at probability or likelihood of below/above normal (average) rainfall," Saws said. "As it stands, the forecast for July-August-September is indicating 'above normal' rainfall, however, the confidence is low." Rain was on the cards for later in the week, Saws said on Monday, but the rain would not be falling in the Cape Metropole. "Cold fronts are slipping south of the country, and hence, not affecting the Cape. There is rain expected for the southern Cape on Wednesday, approximately 5 mm on average. Showers and possible thunderstorm activity across most of the Province for Friday, excluding the Cape Metropole areas, with amounts of 5-10 mm." @LanceTheWitten  lance.witten@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
