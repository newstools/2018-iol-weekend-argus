East London - Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema on Saturday accused prominent businessman Patrice Motsepe and his family of "state capture" in the same way as the Gupta family allegedly did. Addressing a capacity crowd in the 15,000-seat Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane in East London in the Eastern Cape during the EFF's fifth birthday celebrations, Malema said Motsepe "must know his place" and stay away from government because he was not an elected public representative. Malema accused Motsepe of using family ties to President Cyril Ramaphosa and Energy Minister Jeff Radebe to profit on an investment drive launched by Ramaphosa. "There is a new capture here and [it] is led by Patrice Motsepe and the Ruperts. The Ruperts are using Trevor Manuel and Pravin Gordhan, Motsepe is using his brothers in law Cyril [Ramaphosa] and Jeff Radebe. We are watching you Patrice, you must ask [the] Guptas about us..., " Malema said. Malema attacked Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, saying he wanted to privatise state-owned enterprises (SoEs). He claimed Gordhan and former finance minister Trevor Manuel were the ones "running the country" and would privatise SOEs. "Our people are not stupid, they know that Ramaphosa is not in charge, they know that the people that are in change are Pravin Gordhan and Trevor Manuel," said Malema. African News Agency/ANA
