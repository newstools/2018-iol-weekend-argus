Pretoria - The Department of Home Affairs will modernise nine additional offices, bringing the total number of offices with live capture to 193. This was revealed on Monday morning by Minister Malusi Gigaba at a first media briefing since the launch of “War on Queues” in April. Recently, Gigaba directed the department to prepare a comprehensive report and strategy on managing long queues at Home Affairs offices across the country “With regards to progress on the 20 additional bank branches we announced during the Budget Vote in May for the extension of Home Affairs, our banking partners added five more sites and therefore we will now have 25 more sites covering Gauteng, KZN, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, North West, Limpopo, and Mpumalanga,” said Gigaba. He also said they were busy with the installation of the data lines and final preparations of the sites, and will announce their availability for operations as soon as they are ready. Investec and Discovery bank are also going to be on board soon and an announcement will be made as soon as that has been done. “We are currently developing mechanisms to ensure our offices are able to prioritise those that have applied online through the eHomeAffairs channel,” he said. Gigaba also touched on the resignation of Director General Mkuseli Apleni saying he served the public service with distinction. He said under Apleni Home Affairs secured the National Population Register. Apleni confirmed he will be joining Discovery Bank from August 1. 'The War on Queues” comes after people at the Home Affairs department complained about the frustratingly long periods they had to wait to make an application for identity documents and passports. Home Affairs had had "tremendous successes in reducing turnaround times for production of documents". Pretoria News
