But the teenage hijacker bit off more than he could chew when one of the dogs attacked him at the wheel, causing him to crash into a wall. The dog, a golden retriever named Khaya, has since been rescued. A search for the missing dog which fled the crash scene - a Labrador cross named Sasha - is still under way, with a R10 000 reward offered for her safe return. Meanwhile, Schachat is under sedation in a local hospital’s ICU with hip and pelvis fractures and a punctured lung. “It was touch and go for a bit, but we are now confident she will be okay,” said Schachat’s son’s partner Amber Abrams. Abrams said the hijacking happened around 2.30pm on Thursday while Schachat, who runs a dog-walking business, was opening her front gate to park her car which was idling in the driveway with Khaya and Sasha sitting in the back. “Louise had just pulled into her home after walking the dogs,” said Abrams. “As she got out to open the gate, she was jumped. The man got into her car and Louise grabbed him round the neck as he drove off and was dragged along the road. “Apparently, during the chase with the cops Khaya was trying to attack the hijacker. Sasha, the smaller of the two dogs, managed to jump out the window. “Khaya is now safely back home, but we are all concerned about Sasha’s safety.” Sources say the car crashed at Robert Sobukwe Road and Valhalla Drive. Meanwhile police confirmed an 18-year old suspect was arrested and will appear in court tomorrow.
