Cape Town - Motorists beware, thieves are using a new technique to steal from your vehicle. Facebook account Cape Flats Stories issued a warning to check your surroundings before and after climbing out of your vehicle. In a CCTV clip posted on the social network, a suspect is seen rushing to open the door of a white Audi that had just been parked, before the motorist has a chance to lock the car.

With one of the doors open, the vehicle's central locking cannot engage. The motorist, unaware that the back door has been opened, walks away, thinking the vehicle is secured. The suspect then returns moments later, casually approaching the vehicle after pretending to take a phone call, as not to arouse the suspicion of passers-by. He reaches into the vehicle using the back door he had opened earlier, grabs a handbag, and casually walks away.   The Facebook post reads: "* LanRoe Security Update* "The incident in the video took place outside Westerford Kwikspar in Campground road Rondebosch. Watch how the suspect opens the back door of the white Audi as the driver gets out. When the driver walks away and locks the vehicle the car does not lock because the back door is open. Check your surroundings when locking and leaving your vehicle." Motorists are warned to be vigilant and to ensure their doors are locked before leaving their vehicles unattended. @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
