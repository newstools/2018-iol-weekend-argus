Cape Town - The start of a City of Cape Town Council meeting was marred by chaos, following the withdrawal of a motion of no confidence against mayor Patricia de Lille. There has been no official confirmation from either the DA or De Lille about the withdrawal of the motion, with DA FedEx chairperson James Selfe avoiding the media before the council sitting on Thursday morning.

De Lille also avoided questions before she addressed council. “I can’t talk now, I need to go,” De Lille told journalist as she walked to the council chambers where the meeting was held. After the DA caucus meeting, a councillor was seen shouting at Selfe. Another councillor, in support of De Lille’s removal, said they want the motion to go ahead. Asked for comment, JP Smith, DA caucus leader, said: “Only FedEx is speaking on matter. The motion is not going to be tabled today in lieu of Patricia de Lille signing agreement last night.” When De Lille addressed the council meeting, DA councillor Rose Rau turned her back on the mayor.
