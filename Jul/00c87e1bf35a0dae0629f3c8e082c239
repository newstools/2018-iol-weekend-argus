Tristan Thompson has reportedly dropped out of couple's therapy. The 27-year-old basketball player agreed to attend counselling sessions with his girlfriend Khloe Kardashian to help repair their relationship after it came out that he had cheated on her just days before she gave birth to their daughter True in April. But it seems the pair have hit the rocks once again because the sportsman has quit the joint therapy as he's "fed up" of having to talk through the cheating scandal. A source told Us Magazine: "Tristan is feeling trapped in a bad relationship. They tried joint therapy, but now he's no longer going with Khloe for sessions. He just didn't feel it was helping to discuss s*** that happened months ago." Tristan - who plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers - recently moved to Khloe's hometown of Los Angeles, California, with their daughter in a bid to give their relationship another try but it's believed he's now toying with the idea of going back to Ohio. An insider explained: "Khloe and Tristan are still not fully OK. They act like they are when they're in front of others, but it's all a show at this point." Khloe's family - including her mother Kris Jenner and sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kim Kardashian West - were reluctant to forgive Tristan when his infidelity came to light but agreed to give him a second chance for the sake of the blonde beauty.   However, it's thought the 34-year-old reality TV star's famous relatives would much prefer her to leave Tristan and the pair just co-parent amicable for baby True. Kris' friend Lisa Stanley said recently: "If Kris and the family had it their way, she probably would be leaving. They're not okay with this. This guy not only cheated on her it was on video and the world saw it. And she was humiliated. But she's choosing to stay. If all they had it their way, Tristan would just be the baby daddy. And be very much involved. Apparently he's a good father." Bang Showbiz
