Johannesburg - The Constitutional Court has upheld a ruling by Western Cape High Court judge Dennis Davis that it was legal for South Africans to grow cannabis - known locally as dagga - for personal use. In a landmark ruling on Tuesday morning, South Africa's highest court dealt a blow to the Minister of Justice when it dismissed the appeal against Judge Davis's judgment. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, announcing a unanimous verdict, said that certain sections of the legislation covering the use of cannabis was unconstitutional. This means that "no adult will be arrested for being in possession of dagga for personal use in South Africa". In March last year, the Western Cape High Court handed down a ruling that declared sections of the Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act invalid and unconstitutional after an application brought by Rastafarian lawyer Gareth Prince, an advocate for the decriminalisation of marijuana. Prince argued that the criminalisation of dagga use, and the possession of it, was a violation of individuals' right to equality, dignity, and freedom of religion. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
