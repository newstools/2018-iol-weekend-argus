Fans were super amused when Kanye West shared a video of his daughter, North, singing Drake's hit number, "In My Feelings". The post comes just weeks after a fan theory alleged that Kanye's wife, Kim Kardashian West, is actually Kiki, the character Drake refers to in the song.     A post shared by Kanye West (@kanyewest) on Sep 13, 2018 at 1:07pm PDT The fan theory started after The Shade Room posted a video of Nick Cannon and DJ Akademiks discussing the feud between Kim's husband, Kanye West, Pusha T, and Drake, on "Everyday Struggle" with Complex. During the talk, DJ Akademiks claims that the 37-year-old reality star hooked up with Drake at some point. Kim quickly shut down rumours by commenting on the video. The reality star, who's been married to Kanye since 2014, wrote "Never happened. End of story". Meanwhile, Kanye publicly apologised to Drake over their ongoing rap beef. The apology was shared in a series of tweets after snippet surfaced of an upcoming diss track Drake has with French Montana called “No Stylist” which sees Drake rapping "Keeping it G I told her don’t wear no 350’s around me" referencing Kanye's Yeezy Boost 350 sneakers.
