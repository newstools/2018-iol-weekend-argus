Cape Town - Residents of Bonteheuwel have had enough of the City of Cape Town. They chased out the City's officials from a meeting arranged between themselves and Police Minister Bheki Cele. The meeting was set up after Tuesday's #WCShutdown, during which residents from a number of gang-ridden suburbs took to the streets in protest against gangsterism, crime spiralling out of control, and police inefficiencies. Cele had agreed to meet with the people of Bonteheuwel after his engagement at Parliament earlier on Wednesday. Cele's delegation included top cop Jeremy Vearey, the City of Cape Town's safety and security chief JP Smith, and the suburb's ward councillor Angus McKenzie, among other top police officials.

Cele also urged the local government leaders to leave, in the interests of the community. When Smith and McKenzie left their seats, they were followed by jeers and rude hand gestures. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
