The Duchess of Sussex's mother has reportedly made secret visits to the UK to be with her daughter and son-in-law Prince Harry. The former 'Suits' actress - who was known as Meghan Markle before her marriage to Prince Harry - and her husband have seen Doria Ragland on a number of occasions since they tied the knot in May, as the social worker has been giving them her support in the wake of Meghan's father, Thomas Markle, giving a number of interviews about the couple. In July, Doria is said to have spent a lot of time at the couple's cottage in Oxfordshire, where they have been based for most of the summer. A source told the Mail on Sunday newspaper: "The visit was totally under the radar... Doria supported Meghan throughout a lot of the ordeal with Thomas." It is believed Doria may have arrived at the property by helicopter as her daughter and son-in-law often travel in and out by air so as not to disrupt the local country lanes. Meghan's mother made her visits from Los Angeles after 74-year-old Thomas repeatedly criticised the former actress for "cutting him off" as they have not spoken since the day after the royal wedding, which the retired lighting director missed due to undergoing heart surgery. It was recently claimed that though Meghan wants to "maintain a relationship" with her father in the future, she currently wants some space and "time out" from him. A source said: "Royal officials have met and discussed how to deal with him complaining that she has cut him off. They know it is a problem. "Meghan loves Thomas and does want to maintain a relationship with him in the long run. But at the moment she feels he needs and bit of space. She also wants to take a bit of time out. "She is adjusting to married life and her new role in the spotlight. Meghan is hopeful that things will get better but it will take time. There is no quick fix."
