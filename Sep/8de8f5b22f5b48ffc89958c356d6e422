Cape Town - Legendary theatre icon John Kani is set to make his return to the stage next year in a play written by and starring the great thespian. In Kunene and the King, it is South Africa 2019. Twenty-five years since the first post-apartheid democratic elections, two men from contrasting walks of life are thrust together to reflect on a quarter century of change. “We are honoured to be presenting this co-production of John Kani’s new play with The Royal Shakespeare Company, and welcoming him along with Sir Antony Sher and Janice Honeyman back to our Theatre,” said Daniel Galloway, executive director of The Fugard Theatre. He adds: “It is indeed a fitting way to mark 25 years of a democratic South Africa, with three of the country’s internationally acclaimed theatre talents and this important play.” Kunene and the King comes to the Fugard Theatre in April 2019, hot off its world premiere at The Royal Shakespeare Company’s Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in England. This moving and funny two-hander provides a fitting tribute to mark the 25th anniversary of South Africa’s first democratic elections after apartheid. Written by Kani (The Tempest, The Island, Sizwe Banzi is Dead, and movie Black Panther), who was last seen on the Fugard Theatre stage opposite Sandra Prinsloo in So Ry Miss Daisy, Kunene and the King reunites a powerhouse team with director Janice Honeyman with Kani performing opposite Sir Antony Sher (The Tempest, Broken Glass, King Lear, and Death of a Salesman). Kunene and the King will be performed at from April 30. Tickets for the full season go on sale from November 5 with limited early bird specials available through the box office only. Weekend Argus
