Durban - A case of crimen injuria has been laid against ex-convict, Kessie Nair, who this week posted a video on Facebook calling President Cyril Ramaphosa, the K-word. In the almost five-minute long video, Nair demands that Ramaphosa be charged for failing the nation. “I Kessie Nair do hereby call for that (k-word) state president, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, be charged for (de)frauding this nation, for oppressing this nation, for high treason,” he said. Nair said he is prepared to go to jail for his comments. "The marches, the Mandela Days, is a total mockery to the blood, the sacrifices of Nelson Mandela. I am prepared to go to prison for the rest of my life or take a bullet." In his video, Nair said people referring to themselves by race, are creating a divide in the community. He said those who described themselves by their racial description, are racist. The case was opened at the Bayview Police Station by community activist and former eThekwini councillor Brandon Pillay. "The racist online video by ex-convict Kessie Nair is deeply disturbing and this kind of destructive behaviour must be stopped in its tracks,” he said. He said he would also be lodging a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission. Commenting on the postings on social media, Bishop Ruben Philip, said the statements made by Nair were a "disgrace and an embarrassment to the Indian community". Philip, who sits on the province's Council on Social Cohesion, said Nair's comments do not represent the thinking and attitude towards African or any other race group. "One can only think that he is not mentally sound. This is a salient remind to use that these are some of the obstacles that we face on the road to a united South Africa," he said. Nair was jailed for six years in 2005 for fraud amounting to R17 500. Daily News
