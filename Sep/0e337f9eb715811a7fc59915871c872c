Cape Town - His voice is the sound behind Good Hope FM's Comedy Show and while he knows his sport, serving as the station's sports presenter, it's his recounts of school sports day chants that will have you giggling while you reminisce about your own days in school. Dalin Oliver has returned to the Baxter Theatre for the final run of his Face for Radio stand up comedy show. His familiar clean-cut comedy with well-crafted storytelling and cross-generation appeal has a distinctly Capetonian flavour to it and blends his unique experiences of growing up on the cape flats with his culture shock of arriving at a predominately white school. Oliver's show has broad appeal in a society still deeply divided by race and class, and Oliver doesn't pull the punches when discussing the stark differences between growing up white and growing up coloured in Cape Town as he jokes about the first time his friend "Cameron" comes to the hood. The show revolves around his observations of growing up and a running joke throughout the show is the experience of eating Crack-a-Snack chips, which he eloquently describes as "the drunk uncle of chips". Oliver's delivery is well paced and the show never feels like it's dragging on while the pace also makes for fluidity in his storytelling. What's remarkable about his delivery is his confidence in his jokes and anecdotes accompanied by his excellent audience interaction given that he makes fun of himself so often it borders on self-loathing. Face for Radio runs until Saturday at the Baxter Theatre Concert Hall. Weekend Argus
