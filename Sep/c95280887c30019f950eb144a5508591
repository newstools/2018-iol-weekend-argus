Director of the University of Cape Town’s safety and violence initiative, Guy Lamb, said policing was a challenge. “In essence, in an ideal setting the substantially greater numbers of police personnel would be deployed to policing areas in the Western Cape with the high levels of violent crime and the highest levels of fear of crime among residents,” he said. “SAPS, metro police, law enforcement and the Western Cape government would work closely together in a partnership based on mutual trust to share information and resources to improve safety and reduce crime. “There would also be a close working relationship with communities and other national government departments to jointly problem-solve factors that directly contribute to violent crime,” he said. Lamb said gang violence was a challenge for policing the world over. Leadership at police cluster and station levels also played a role in policing success. He said reliable and accurate crime intelligence, good working relationships with credible community police forums and neighbourhood watch structures were also needed. Weekend Argus
