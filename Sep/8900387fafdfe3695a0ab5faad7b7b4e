Taking to Twitter on Wednesday, EFF Commander in Chief Julius Malema tweeted, "That micasa guy called Jsomething will keep land under the @EFFSouthAfrica government".      This admission caused quite the amusement for the Twitterverse with tweeps even throwing out their own nominees.                                         J'Something hasn't responded to the tweet, but we're sure he had a good chuckle about it.
