DURBAN - A fatal crash during the early hours of Saturday morning claimed the lives of two young women in their 20s, including Durban actress Owethu Enhle Gambushe, who starred on a local etv drama. Gambushe, 22, played the role of Nonhlanhla in the local drama Imbewu: The Seed. Rescue Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said paramedics arrived on the scene near Sydenham Road and Botanic Gardens Road just after 1am to find a vehicle which had crashed into a wall. Jamieson said five people had been in the vehicle. “The vehicle which had five occupants somehow lost control before colliding with a road sign and then into the wall. Two females believed to be in their twenties were found to have sustained major injuries and were declared deceased at the scene,” said Jamieson. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a 47-year-old man who had been driving the vehicle had been arrested. She said the man, who had been driving in the same vehicle with the deceased, would be charged with culpable homicide and driving under the influence of intoxicating substances. Mbele said the man would appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Monday and said police were investigating the circumstances that led to the crash. Leleti Khumalo, the executive producer of the show Imbewu: The Seed, said cast members were deeply saddened by the passing of Gambushe. "It's unbelievable, we are sad. We are liaising with the family and they have requested space to deal with this tragedy," said Khumalo. nabeelah.shaikh@inl.co.za
