METHOD Season the snoek with salt and pepper and allow to marinate for 30 minutes before patting dry with a paper towel. Cook the butter and garlic on the stove until foamy, and add the rest of the ingredients. Mix well. Coat the snoek in the olive oil (this prevents it from sticking to the grid), and baste on both sides. Close the grid and braai for 12 - 15 minutes, while constantly basting with the marinade. Serving suggestion: use the leftover apricot butter as a side sauce. @capetimes  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
