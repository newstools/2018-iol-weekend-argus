The old apartheid-era South African flag – the ‘driekleur’ – was brandished at the Westpac Stadium in Wellington on Saturday during the Springboks’ Rugby Championship Test against the All Blacks. Television images showed the flag being hung at one of the tunnels at the stadium during the 64th minute of the match, with the Boks leading 36-29 at the time. Siya Kolisi’s team went on to record the South Africans’ first victory over the All Blacks in New Zealand since 2009 – and the first ever at the Westpac Stadium – with a memorable 36-34 triumph. But the sight of the old SA flag drew sharp criticism on social media, with many people sharing the sentiment that it was an unwelcome sight. “This is so pathetic. Leaving SA then flying the old flag at a Bok game. We must be part of the solution, not the problem!” comedian Bouwer Bosch tweeted.      “Not offended by the flag. It’s a piece of cloth. It’s the intention behind it. I’m not bling (blind) towards the reality of SA. But how is waving the apartheid flag helping? It brings up hurt for millions of black people, thats my problem today. History is present today still.” New Zealand rugby commentator Tony Johnson also slammed the flying of the old SA flag...      Former Titans cricketer Pierre Joubert added: “Great Bok win - Lifts the mood massively!! Idiot with old SA flag, stay in NZ! This must now become the norm, to beat the All Blacks - we should not be surprised about a result like this!! Upwards from here....”                     IOL Sport
