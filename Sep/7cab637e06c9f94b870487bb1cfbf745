Opperman’s body was found on Tuesday morning by a passer-by. Her neighbours in Suikerbos Street are still shocked by her death. The principal and founder of Family Tree Crèche in Lentegeur, who didn’t want to be identified, said her death was disturbing. “As a person who knew Lindsay as a young girl, she was a very bright, quiet and loving child,” she said Kauthar Ismail said she and Lindsay grew up together. “She was a fun and loving person.” Zaltoon Ismail, Kauthar’s sister, said, “I cannot express how this breaks my heart. Has this become our fate as young women in this country?” Another neighbour said Lindsay had a drug problem. “I had been suspecting something strange was going on with her. Lindsay got married when she was 18, and had problems and fights with her husband. Later she was using drugs. After she broke up with her husband, she moved to her home, and her mother, who died five years ago, use to take her to the rehabilitation centre.” “Drugs are a huge problem in this community, with many children being hooked,” other neighbours said. Community members are pleading with the City of Cape Town to build houses or other developments in the bush in Morgans Village. One said: “This bush is our death pool, Linday’s death is not the first incident there.” Police spokesperson Lt-Col André Traut said there has been no arrest yet. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
