Pretoria - Child safety has again come under scrutiny as a man allegedly preyed on a 6-year-old girl at a restaurant in Pretoria and later followed her to the toilet, where he raped her. The 20-year-old man made a brief appearance in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday on a charge of rape. He appeared to have been beaten badly, and had a split ear. The matter was postponed to October 2 for further investigation and the accused will remain in custody. The incident allegedly took place in a toilet at the Dros restaurant in Silverton on Saturday. The man had allegedly been scouting and preying on the child for some time while she was in the children’s area, and waited for her to go to the toilet. An eyewitness told Radio 702: "I have seen this guy in the restaurant before, even the waitresses know this guy. When he got there, he was sitting near the kids play area, while he was having a glass of water, he had his eye on the area, looking at her and waited for her to go to the toilet and followed her." A Facebook post moments after the incident read: “This man just raped a 6-year-old in the toilet; police are here.” The girl was reportedly bleeding when the police arrived at the scene. It was claimed the suspect was beaten up when Dros management locked him in the toilet to avoid mob justice. Dros management said they were investigating the matter. Pretoria News
