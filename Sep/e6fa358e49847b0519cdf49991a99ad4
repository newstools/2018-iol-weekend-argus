Cape Town - Hundreds of new home owners in the province received title deeds to their properties this week, some after years of waiting for a chance to have their own houses. According to DA Western Cape Provincial leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela, the party assisted more than 1000 people with becoming first-time home owners. "The DA-led Western Cape government helped over 1000 people across the province become home owners with the security of a title deed. While the ANC/EFF want the people of our country to be dependent on the state, the DA governments are empowering residents through real land reform efforts," Madikizela said. Over 500 title deeds were handed over in the Overstrand municipality on Monday, which included properties in the Zwelihle, Hawston, Paradise Park, Mount Pleasant and Kleinmond areas. Meanwhile on Thursday, 329 title deeds were handed over in Oudtshoorn and 200 in Mossel Bay. The party hopes to facilitate more handovers to residents of Langberg and Grabouw next week. "We are proud of the work our governments are doing. There are still many families that need our help and we will continue to work hard so that we can change people’s lives one house at a time," Madikizela said. @capetimes  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
