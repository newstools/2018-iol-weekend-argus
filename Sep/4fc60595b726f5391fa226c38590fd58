Now the 24-year-old comedian from Paarl has been nominated in the newcomer of the year category at the Savanna Comics’ Choice Awards. “I actually wanted to turn off my phone the day they announced the nominees because I was so nervous. But before I could, the messages started coming through of congratulations,” said Johnson. She describes her comedy as a reflection of her life that remains highly relatable to younger audiences. “I talk about being a young woman in South Africa, being extremely single and I talk about my parents. Johnson is nominated in the category alongside Bongani Dube, Tsitsi Chiumya, Gilli Apter and Nonto Rubushe. “I think we all stand such a good chance of winning because there are some fantastic comics nominated. I don’t want to think about winning because I might disappoint myself.” The comedian said she ended up in comedy “randomly” after entering an open-mic competition where she placed second. “That competition was hosted by another comedian and he helped me to find my way in the comedy world. I will always be a full-time comedian and try to perform as much as possible.” She has performed at the Cape Town Comedy Club, Rocking the Daisies 2016 and, most recently, the Jive Cape Town Funny Festival 2017. Johnson said she reflected on the past Women’s Month and said more female comedians needed to be encouraged to pursue their talents. “People have always laughed at my jokes, but before I was a comedian, no one ever said that being a comedian was an option for me. “We need to encourage women from a young age to go after their talents.” Darling-based comedian and actor Pieter-Dirk Uys will also receive the lifetime achiever recipient award for his contribution to comedy over the past 40 years, particularly for his drag act Evita Bezuidenhout. The Savanna Comics’ Choice Awards is on Saturday at The Lyric Theatre, Gold Reef City in Joburg. Weekend Argus
