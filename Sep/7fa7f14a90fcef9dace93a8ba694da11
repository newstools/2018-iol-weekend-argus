Cape Town - Founder of euthanasia advocacy group Dignity SA Sean Davison was granted R20 000 bail on Wednesday morning in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court, where he appeared on a charge of murder. Davison was granted bail of R20 000 with strict conditions restricting him from leaving the Western Cape without permission or contacting any witnesses. He is due back in court on November 16. The 57-year-old was arrested at his home on Tuesday following the execution of a search warrant on a 2013 matter involving the death of 43-year-old Dr Anrich Burger who became a quadriplegic following a car accident. Through his lawyer, Davison said that he intends to plead not guilty on the charge of murder. Davison's arrest comes just weeks after his organisation hosted a pro-euthanasia conference in Cape Town calling for the legalisation of the right by terminally ill patients to choose when to end their life Currently the practice is illegal in the country. Dignity SA co-founder Willen Landman confirmed Davison was arrested on Tuesday at this home following the execution of a search warrant. “So far we understand that the charge is of premeditated murder related to the death of Dr Burger,” he said. “There was a search warrant with the Hawks involved and his laptop and cellphone were seized and he is expected to appear at the Cape Town Magistrate's Court this morning to hear on possible bail.” NPA spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said outside the court on Wednesday that from information obtained from the search and seizure it came to light that Davison may have committed other similar offences.      * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
