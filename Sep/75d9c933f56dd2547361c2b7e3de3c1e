Our modernised look showcases the latest news, trends and what’s happening in and around Cape Town, such as avid runners gearing up for the annual Sanlam Cape Town Marathon in three weeks and a new sparkling wine on the market. For more national and international features, turn to our stunning new lifestyle magazine, Affluence. This month also marks Heritage Month, so we have dedicated the space on the Editor’s Choice page to telling stories about our Cape Town heritage. We kick off with a look at Khayelitsha - the second largest township in South Africa and in existence for 35 years. Also in keeping with Heritage Month, we tell the story of the Green Point lighthouse and the history of other local lighthouses. Not too far from the lighthouse are the suburbs of Bantry Bay and Sea Point, where we delve into the crime statistics and the greatest concerns of the residents. We are proud to bring you new writers and lifestyle content - and don’t miss our regular columns by Ryland Fisher, Michael Weeder and Andrew Donaldson. Your favourite puzzles can be found inside the Affluence supplement, which brings together the best of past features such as travel and Jellybean Journal, enhancing the offering for the entire family. We will continue to bring you the best in sport with hard news and great news features - see the back page. The new design extends to all the great titles which are part of Independent Media.
