Sogiba, with her children aged 18, 11 and 5, was officially moved from Bardale, Mfuleni, into a new two-bedroom home in Delft this week. Before moving to Bardale, Sogiba lived in Town Two and Greenpoint in Khayelitsha and in Crossroads. She wept while speaking about her experiences. “My parents were founding residents of Town Two, but I’ve been wandering, looking for a proper place to stay in. I’ve been evicted on numerous occasions,” she said. “I’m so relieved this week. It’s like a dream. I’ve been suffering. Two of my children were sick for long periods. Now I have a house, but it was not without struggle. I’ve been to every City of Cape Town office, getting sent from pillar to post. “Councillors ignored me. I didn’t feel like a human in the community. I was used as a tool for parties’ election campaigning.” She hugged Mayor Patricia de Lille a number of times when she showed her around the new house. It would not have been possible for Sogiba to get her home were it not for the relentless assistance of activist Ndoda Ludidi who, together with two friends, knocked on every door in the civic centre. De Lille fast-tracked the process and met Sogiba at her new home, where the mayor was approached by a blind 90-year-old woman who has been waiting for a house since the advent of democracy. De Lille took down the woman’s contact details and said she would look into her situation. “It was heart-warming to see the tears of joy in Sheila Sogiba’s eyes when I handed her the keys to her new home in Delft,”De Lille said. “I was honoured to share the moment with her as she walked through her two-bedroom home with a bathroom, kitchen and living area. It is a far cry from the shack she stayed in before where she had to battle the elements to care for her children,” said De Lille. Weekend Argus
