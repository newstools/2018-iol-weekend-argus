Ramjettan’s cousin, Niresh Singh, said the family offered the reward in the hope of finding out why he was killed, which would help give them closure. “He had no known enemies. The way he was killed is very troubling for the family,” Singh said. The Daily News reported last month that Ramjettan was killed while standing outside his Engen garage, Glazer Motors, on South Coast Road, Umbilo. A man had walked up to Ramjettan, shot him in the head and ran away. Singh said his cousin died at the scene. He said Ramjettan’s parents were struggling to deal with their son’s death, and their health was deteriorating. Singh described Ramjettan as a person with a bubbly personality. He is survived by his wife, Lonica, and 2-year-old son Kiaan. Prethumb Bechan, the family spokesperson, said Lonica was finding it difficult to deal with the loss of her husband. He said Kiaan was still asking for his dad because he did not understand what had happened. People who have information can contact Warrant Officer Rajen Nagaser at 083 795 1295. Daily News
