Cape Town - Award-winning play Die reuk van appels will celebrate its 100th performance at the Fugard theatre next month when it returns for another Cape Town run. The drama is the coming-of-age story of Marnus Erasmus, 11-year-old son of a South African Defence Force (SADF) general. It eloquently captures the Afrikaner mentality in the late 1970s and early 1980s and the brutal consequences of apartheid and militarisation of South African life. Presented by Theatrerocket Productions and adapted for the stage by Johann Smith, it stars Gideon Lombard in the lead role and is performed in Afrikaans with English surtitles. Director Lara Bye won the Best Director kykNET Fiësta Award; playwright Johann Smith won the award for Best Adaptation of an Existing Work while the production was awarded the coveted Best Overall Production of the Year. It will hit its 100th performance on November 3. “We have been overwhelmed and humbled by the critical acclaim, awards recognition and responses from our audiences,” says Johan van der Merwe, co-founder of Theatrerocket Productions. “We are delighted to be bringing this powerful, seminal work back to Cape Town for a return run at The Fugard Studio Theatre.” The Afrikaans drama was adapted from author Mark Behr’s debut novel of the same name, which was released in 1993. Upon publication and subsequent translation into English (as The Smell of Apples) that same year, this landmark Afrikaans novel catapulted Behr into the ranks of young and talented dissident voices such as Etienne van Heerden and Koos Prinsloo. Before his untimely death on in 2015, Behr was a professor of creative writing at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee. With the success of the stage adaption, new interest has been generated in the novel, and the publishers have decided to print another impression of Die reuk van appels. Die reuk van appels will run at the Fugard Studio Theatre from October 23 to November 17. Weekend Argus
