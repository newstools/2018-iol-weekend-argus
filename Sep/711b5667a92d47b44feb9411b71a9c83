Cape Town - The six candidates to take over the mayoral chains from Patricia de Lille will be interviewed from Monday. DA leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said the six candidates have made the shortlist and will be interviewed by a panel of 20 members from various DA structures. The six candidates are DA Gauteng MPL Heinrich Volmink, mayco member for urban development and transport Brett Herron, Community Safety MEC Dan Plato, Western Cape Legislature Speaker Sharna Fernandez, current deputy mayor Ian Neilson and relatively unknown city DA member Sumaya Taliep. “Essentially what we want is a mayor that will heal the divisions in the caucus there. The best person has to heal the problems, because it is no secret that we have a divided caucus in Cape Town. For me, and certainly for the DA that is the best person we would want to be mayor. What is also important is to deliver services and build on what has already been built up,” Madikizela said.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.  On the selection panel, there are 10 members from the party’s federal executive, 5 from the provincial executive and 5 from the regional leadership. We've posed four of the better known candidates some tough questions about why they're running for mayor. * Fiona Furey is a freelance radio and online TV broadcaster Cape Argus
