Dams supplying the City of Cape Town are at a collective 66%, according to the Western Cape department of local government, environmental affairs and development planning. "The average dam level in the Western Cape has increased to 58% (2017:34%)," the department said. "The situation shows a marked improvement at the end of the winter season and indicates the difference the winter rains have made across the province. "At the start of the winter season, the average dam level for the province was 16%. Local government, environmental affairs and development planning MEC in the provice, Anton Bredell, said dams feeding the City of Cape Town are currently at 66% (2017: 35%). "Major dams feeding the city include the Berg River Dam (currently 96% full) and the Steenbras Upper dam (100%) and Steenbras Lower Dam (86%) as well as the Theewaterskloof Dam which currently stands at 48.7% full. Unfortunately there remains no relief for the Karoo regions with the average Dam level in the Gouritz River Catchment area still below 18% on average," Bredell said. Bredell has requested that consumers continue to use water sparingly, "with the focus on the coming summer season when demand is expected to pick up again".
