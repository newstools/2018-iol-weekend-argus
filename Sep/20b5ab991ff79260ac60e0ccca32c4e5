Mac Miller has died at the age of 26. The American rap star - who previously dated Ariana Grande - was found unconscious at his home in the San Fernando Valley at around midday on Friday (07.09.18), and he was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics, according to TMZ. Miller - whose real name is Malcolm McCormick - has battled with substance abuse for years, and TMZ says his death was caused by an overdose.Â Prior to his death, Miller had been sharing behind-the-scenes videos of his home life on his Instagram account. In the video clips, the rapper - whose two-year relationship with Ariana ended in May - showed a turntable that played his track 'So It Goes'. Earlier this week, Miller spoke candidly about his trouble dealing with the pressures of fame. Reflecting on the stresses of success, he said: "There's pressure. A lot of times in my life I've put this pressure to hold myself to the standard of whatever I thought I was supposed to be, or how I was supposed to be perceived. "It's the job. This is what I signed up for. So, you just have to not. You have to have your own reality and that has to be the driving force of your life. "Do I wish that every single thing I did when I was 19 wasn't a discussion? Sure." Miller struggled with sobriety in the aftermath of his high-profile split from Ariana, and last month, he was charged with two counts of Driving Under the Influence. The American star was found to be twice the legal alcohol limit when he was arrested for drink driving back in May. Following his arrest, Ariana - who is now engaged to TV star Pete Davidson - tweeted: "Pls take care of yourself. (sic)" Bang Showbiz
