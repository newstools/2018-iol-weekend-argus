South Africa made its decision on Sunday tonight when the Top 10 contestants of Idols South Africa were announced. The announcement was made at a star-studded event live show. Held at the Pretoria State Theatre, viewers watched as the 8 male and 8 female contestants performed for their spot in the Top 10. The guys performed Bruno Mars "Finesse," while the ladies performed Rihanna’s "Only Girl" and "We Found Love."           The night's entertainment included Tipcee, Joejo, former Idols SA finalist Thami, Heavy K & Ntombi, Lady Zamar, and DJ Maphorisa, DJ Raybel, TDK Macassette, Zulu Mkhathini and Moonchild.      The Top 10 include Yanga Sobetwa, Thando Mngomezulu, Xae, Ntokozo Makhathini, Nosipho Silinda, Niyaaz Arendse, Lincoln Lewis, Mthokozisi Ngcobo, Thato Makape and King B.       More about the Top 10: Basimane Boys Melato aka King B (19) was the first to hear the magic words “You’re in the Top 10!” from host Proverb. The HR student from Kagiso has been a firm favourite since his dazzling Theatre Week performance that saw him get a standing ovation, which he followed up with another crowd-pleasing performance during the Top 16 Boys show. He reciprocated the love with his now trademark vosho…as Kings do!      Yanga Sobetwa (17) is flying the Generation Z flag high and proud. Following the footsteps of last season’s teen victor, Paxton, Season 14’s youngest contestant has stepped out of the Cape Town township of Langa straight into the national spotlight. Could she be next star from Langa, like the timeless Brenda Fassie? Nosipho Silinda (18) recently celebrated her birthday in the Idols house, and South Africa gifted the Grade 11 pupil from Ladysmith in KZN with a spot in the Top 10. Ntokozo Makhathini (18) must be drinking the same Witbank water as her neighbour, Idols season nine winner Musa. Whatever it is, she’s keeping her small town on the map with her inclusion in the Top 10. It looks like her passion for conservation tourism will have to wait a little longer. Zamagambu Memela aka Xae (19) made Idols history by becoming the first contestant to get a Golden Ticket autographed – by all the judges. While that was a sweet but meaningless gesture, making it into the Top 10 is a big deal for the youngster from Pinetown, Durban. Thando Mngomezulu (19) finally overcame her crippling lack of confidence to give a dynamite performance that saw the country showing their appreciation with votes. South Africa spoke, the judges listened, and Thando from Jozi made it to the Top 10. Mthokozisi Nqcobo (20) may have had only two pairs of shoes when he first auditioned, but his spot in the Top 10 proves walking in them to the audition was worth it. The Umlazi, Durban, native is finally on stage doing what he says heals his heart – singing. Thato Makape (23) is the epitome of courage and determination, as his inclusion in the Top 10 proves. A barber from Postmasburg in the Northern, Makape travelled nearly 10 000km for an audition in Cape Town. Sunday, South Africa showed him that the journey was worth it. Lincoln Lewis (22) from Ravensmead on the Cape Flats has been bringing fire every time he steps on stage. After being told he had given judges “the best audition of the season so far”, he went on to impress during Theatre Week and received a unanimous thumbs-up for his Top 16 performance. Now South Africa wants to see more. Niyaaz Arendse (22) snatched the last spot in the Top 10. After many years of rejection on the show, it was no wonder the youngster from Ottery, Cape Town, was so overcome with emotion. It was on this emotional high that the curtain came down on tonight’s show.
