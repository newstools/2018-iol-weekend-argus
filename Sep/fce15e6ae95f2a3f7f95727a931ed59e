A gunman who had locked himself inside the administrative section of the Capitec Bank on Voortrekker Road in Bellville on Wednesday has been taken into custody. According to Western Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut, all roads around the building have also been reopened. The man was believed to have been a client of the bank at the ESC Building. Traut said the man was arrested on the charge of pointing a firearm, with a likelihood of further charges being added. The stand-off ended around 5pm. Police said the gun-toting man had entered the branch shortly before 2pm in what was initially suspected to have been an attempted robbery. It was also thought that the man had taken two people inside the bank hostage, but Traut said at the time this was not a hostage situation. People could be seen running out of the bank, which led to the gunman being cordoned off. "The man is on his own in the bank. It is not a hostage situation. We will now negotiate with him to come out," said Traut, who said the man had a demand for the bank. Capitec communications head Charl Nel had earlier told News24 via email: "This is an administrative office and call centre where no cash is held on the premises. Capitec Bank employees have been evacuated and no employees or clients are in danger." Before the suspect had been apprehended, Traut told Weekend Argus when asked what would happen if the suspect emerged from the building firing his weapon, "we are prepared". He would not confirm how many police officers had been on the ground. However, the K9 Unit were on the scene, along with members of the City's Law Enforcement Unit. Voortrekker Road also had to be closed in both directions between Durban Road and AJ West Road during the incident.
