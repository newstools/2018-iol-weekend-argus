DURBAN - Miguel Louw, the Sydenham schoolboy who went missing in July, was laid to rest on Saturday. Nine-year-old Miguel's body lay in a closed white and gold coffin as hundreds of mourners gathered at the St Anne’s Church in Sydenham to bid farewell to the child. A frame sat atop his coffin with a picture of the little boy., and a white balloon with the words ‘Miguel Louw’ was placed at the head of the coffin. Miguel, who went missing on July 18, was found buried in a shallow grave in Phoenix two weeks ago. His body was in the late stages of decomposition. According to Reverend Father Ndodana Tshuma, Miguel’s death has brought families and communities together. He added that the boy had perhaps served a greater purpose. Tshuma also urged parents to take a stand to protect children. “Miguel, lying here in this state is proof that we live in a sick society,” he said.

Miguel’s father, Kirk Louw, wrote: “Daddy will always have you in his heart. Although I cannot see you, I feel you with me, even though you’re gone too soon.” Older sister, Mikayla, after comforting her mother, read a poem.Miguel’s body will be cremated, the family announced as they left the church with blue and white balloons and doves flying behind them - a celebration of the child’s life.
