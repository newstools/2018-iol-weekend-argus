Cape Town - Alan Winde has been named the DA’s premier candidate for the Western Cape, party leader Mmusi Maimane announced on Wednesday. "It gives me great pleasure to announce to you that the DA candidate for Premier of the Western Cape in the 2019 elections is Alan Winde. "I congratulate Alan on his election as our candidate through a rigorous internal process. Alan has a mandate to win this province again, and to fly the flag of excellent DA government here for years to come. Maimane further said: "He has the full support of the DA’s national leadership team, his fellow candidates, and the provincial leadership team in this province. Our colleague, Bonginkosi Madikizela, was also a candidate for the position, and is the provincial leader of the Western Cape." The party’s federal executive (FedEx) met in Cape Town on Tuesday to deliberate on candidates for premier. The announcement comes after it emerged that Maimane withdrew a nomination to become the province’s number one citizen, although initial reports said that he imposed himself on the DA for the position. Reaction to this has been mixed, with analysts saying Maimane’s decision would divide the party. IOL
