Durban - A Parkgate homeowner got the shock of their life when they came across a deadly two-metre-long black mamba on Tuesday. Members of the private security company, Reaction Unit SA  (Rusa)  were called out to the home on Wimbledon Grove shortly before 7pm on Tuesday. "Upon arrival Reaction Officers found the snake wrapped around a burglar bar in the living room," Rusa spokesman, Prem Balram said. "Professional snake catcher Jason Arnold of Universal Reptiles was called to the scene and upon arrival, the snake was safely removed from the home. The mamba would be relocated to its natural environment away from homes," Balram said. According to the Kruger Park website, the black mamba is named for the colour of the inside of its mouth, which is black. This is clearly displayed when it is threatened. The snake has a matt, brownish-grey body with a light belly. Its preferred habitat includes termite mounds, hollow tree trunks, granite hillocks and moist savannah and lowland forests. An adult snake reaches an average length of 2.5m. The longest black mamba (and current record length), measuring 4.4m, was found in Zimbabwe. Unlike popular perception, the website says the snake is not aggressive and will do anything in its power to head away from humans rather than attack. Daily News
