It all started when Sunday World published an article about Matheba’s alleged “tax fraud”. The newspaper stated Matheba was being investigated for failing to submit her full tax returns. Matheba slammed the article as fake news and has brought a R10million lawsuit against the newspaper. This is where Mphela enters the ring. He took to Twitter and weighed in. “Moghel should have just let this go. It’s tabloid and responding or suing only gives the story traction. I don’t think it is wise for her to be waging a war with journos. Her influence is waning & she needs positive coverage to remain at the top,” he tweeted. Matheba replied: “Go f*** yourself!” And it all went downhill from there. The powerhouse, who has made a name for herself across Africa, then told Mphela that his obsession with her was tiring. She went on: “You’re a parasite. A scumbag. A disgusting example of the filth I have to deal with daily. You know nothing about the industry you claim to work in... Die slow! Your mess ends today!” Mphela hit back, “ I’m done being nice. F*** you too @bonang_m. Your delusion of grandeur is getting to your head." This is where the boxing ring gets bigger. Mphela tweeted: “You lie. You come here and spin some BS nonsense. Wanna do this? Let’s go right back to Sun City 2012.” Sun City replied: "What happens at Sun City stays at Sun City,” much to everyone’s amusement. Davin Phillips, the executive director of Celebrity Services Africa, which manages Matheba, said that his client would still be following through with her lawsuit. Weekend Argus
