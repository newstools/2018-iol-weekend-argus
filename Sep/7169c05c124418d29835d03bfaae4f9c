Cape Town - The stage is officially set for the 2018 Sanlam Cape Town Marathon, with athletes from around the world arriving in the Mother City to hit the asphalt for one of the world's most grueling races. Organisers of this year's event say it's the deepest field yet, with athletes from both South Africa and abroad gunning for the top prize. And since defending champion Asefa Negewo won't be competing in the 2018 race, it's anyone's guess just which athlete will be crossing the finish line in poll position on Sunday, September 23. The elite field was presented at a press conference held at the Cullinan Hotel on Friday morning. Spearheading it is South Africa’s 10km record holder and the race's most consistent marathoner of the last few years, Stephen Mokoka. His 2:07.40 from Shanghai from 2015 is the fastest in the field. Since then he has gone 2:10.18 (Shanghai, 2016), 2:16.53 (Tokyo, February 2017) and 2:08.35 in Shanghai, in November 2017.  Earlier this year, Mokoka competed at the Commonwealth Games in the 10 000m and ran his second-best time (27:44.58). He's renowned for a viciously fast finish and should the race come down to two or more athletes in the last kilometre, organisers say Mokaka will fancy his chances of winning a sprint to the line. Kenyan Jacob Chesari Korir is another one to watch, and could be a big threat to Mokoka with his 2:07.47 run in Frankfurt in 2013. His more recent form has seen Korir clock 2:09.24 in Barcelona in 2017. Another Kenyan, Albert Korir, is pegged to be extremely confident after finishing second this year in the Otsu Lake Biwa Marathon, clocking his personal best marathon time of 2:08.17. Korir previously won the 2017 Vienna Marathon in a time of 2:08.40. Ethiopia’s Fikre Assefa boasts a best of 2:08.36 run in the 2017 Kosice Marathon where he finished second, and Spain’s Ayad Lamdassen comes in with 2:09.28. But the man who's received the most hype in the run-up to this year's marathon is 29-year-old South African Desmond Mokgobu, who has been trained by 2004 New York Marathon winner, Hendrick Ramaala. Mokgobu has already won this year’s Beppu Marathon in February, earning him gold label status, and will be a serious threat to Mokaka's gold medal aspirations. His constant improvement and big win in February will have given Mokgubo a huge dose of confidence and he will feel he does not need to fear any athlete on the day. In the women's division, Namibia’s Helalia Johannes, who finished second in the 2017 race, is the pre-race favourite. With a career best of 2:26.09 run at the London Olympics in 2012, Johannes has broken 2:30 on four occasions and knowing the route after last year’s pacing duties, must hold an edge over the rest of the field. She is also renowned as a tough racer, claiming the 2018 Commonwealth Games Marathon title in 2:32.40 – run in almost brutal conditions. Namibia’s Helalia Johannes.

South Africa will be represented by Gold Label Athlete Nolene Conrad, who ran her best of 2:35.21 in Valencia in 2017. South Africa's Nolene Conradie.

"This is another big coup for the Sanlam Cape Town Marathon as it shows that the race is becoming more and more attractive to the world’s best. It would be absolutely incredible if either Stephen Mokoka or Desmond Mokgobu were to win the men’s race. And if Nolene (Conrad) triumphs in the women’s race, that would have huge significance,” said Elana van Zyl-Meyer, ambassador for the Sanlam Cape Town Marathon. @capetimes  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Town
