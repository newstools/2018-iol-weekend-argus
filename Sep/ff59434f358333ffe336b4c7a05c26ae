After shocking news of a North West teacher who was stabbed to death by a 17-year-old boy last week, figures released by the Western Cape Education Department reveal that local teachers are also under attack. Since the beginning of the year, the department received four reports of pupil-to-teacher sexual abuse, and 26 cases of pupil-to-teacher verbal abuse. The National Professional Teachers’ Organisation of SA (Naptosa), reported 28 cases of assault of teachers by pupils. Naptosa, the second largest teacher’s union in the education sector, said there were six cases of parent-to-teacher assault registered in the same period. Naptosa senior executive officer Ridwaan Ahmed said: “There has been an alarming increase in the number of assaults by learners on our educators at Western Cape schools.” Ahmed said assault was the most common act of violence by pupils on teachers at schools. Asked how they’re addressing the violence, he said: “Our view is that we need a collaborative approach from all stakeholders, including Naptosa, the SA Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu), the Department of Community Safety, the police and a risk management stakeholder.” Ahmed said not enough research has been done on why pupils are assaulting teachers. “There are obviously people who believe it’s related to the abolition of corporal punishment, but that is not the position of Naptosa. “Substance abuse appears to be a contributing factor,” Ahmed said. He said he would request information from other provinces so he could gauge how bad the situation was. “We have developed an advocacy plan around the issue of safety of educators. We’ve just finalised a draft flyer for educators on what should happen when they are attacked,” he said. Weekend Argus
