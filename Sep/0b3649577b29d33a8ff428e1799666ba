Organisers said 20 000 participants from around the world would be running on Sunday. Olympian and race ambassador Elana van Zyl-Meyer said: “Our commitment is to provide runners, supporters and spectators with a truly gold-label experience that’s on a par with the likes of London, Berlin or New York.” The Century City Conference Centre will house the registration and expo on September 21 between 9am and 7pm and on September 22 between 9am and 5pm. This year’s expo promises to be a show stopper, with leading brands including Asics, Saucony, Totalsports, Sun International, Nestlé and Fedhealth exhibiting. Participants have to register at the conference centre, where they can also collect their goodie bags. Organisers have encouraged runners to register as early as possible on the Friday and Saturday to avoid the last-minute crowds. “The Sanlam Cape Town Marathon promotes health and wellness, and participation in an endurance event is one way in which people are able to transform their lifestyles. I call on all industry leaders to support the Captains Challenge and lead by example,” says Francois Pienaar, Chairperson and Patron, Sanlam Cape Town Marathon.
