Durban - A homeless man who had been chasing after a chicken stumbled upon a bone sticking out of the sea sand near Suncoast Beach on Wednesday. The man followed the chicken into the enclosed area of a sand dune where he found a bone. He then brought the bone out and informed beachfront security guards and the police of his find. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, confirmed that the man was looking for food in the dense bush. "Police were called out to the Mangroves near Suncoast. The man found a skull partially buried in the dunes. Police found skeletal remains of a spinal column and a pelvis buried in the dunes. An inquest docket was at Durban Central police station for investigation," Zwane said. The Police Search and Rescue Unit was called in to search the dunes with a sniffer dog. Police believe that many religious ceremonies are held, where chickens and goats are sacrificed, on the beach sands to remove bad luck. Some of these chickens escape during the prayer. Police also noted the number of vagrants that frequent these dunes to find shelter. Daily News
