The blue designer gown that Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, wore to a gala concert last week set tongues wagging that the royal might be pregnant. This comes after fans claimed that the billowing front panels on the Jason Wu dress gave the impression of Prince Harry’s wife trying to conceal a rounded stomach. Meghan's alleged bump became a hot topic on social media, so much that even TV news outlets weighed in on the matter.      The Australian gossip weekly New Idea also reported that a source from Kensington Palace confirmed the pregnancy. "In very happy news, a Kensington Palace insider has confirmed that the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant and has all but cleared her diary to ensure she rests as much as possible," the article stated last week. A recent report in the Daily Star also claims that Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland, is taking "newborn specialist classes" at the Cradle Company in the US. However, claims that Meghan has cleared her diary conflicts with the royal couples planned trip to New Zealand next month. The Duke and Duchess will spend five days touring New Zealand after attending the Invictus Games in Sydney and following visits to Fiji and Tonga.
