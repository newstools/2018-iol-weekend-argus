During her radio show on Saturday, Ranaka referred to Bonang Matheba as a 'straatmate' and the BForce is not happy about it. Taking to Twitter Matheba's superfans dragged the radio personality while their queen is living her best life at New York Fashion Week.                               Unbothered by the fans' reaction, Ranaka doubled down on her comments on air, tweeting that she is not God and that she can talk about Matheba whenever she wanted to.     Wanyela wena! Bonang ke Modimo wa mang! I’ll talk about her as much as I want! Tjo la re tlwayela waitsi. Ke tshabe go bua ka ena because ena ke mang pila pila?????? https://t.co/K8OBnbqD2Z — #BabyMamasFilm (@dineoranaka)
