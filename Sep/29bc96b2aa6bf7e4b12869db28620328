"Now for its third year running, the race organisers have managed to bring in one international driver, Dan Cross and people have responded with bigger audiences than last year," Smith said. "The City has increased sponsorship this year to R150 000 towards City services (all safety and security, as well as cleansing and solid waste) and free usage of the Grand Parade.
