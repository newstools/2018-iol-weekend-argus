Durban - One of Durban's top cops has taken over the investigation into the body found in a shallow grave in Phoenix that may be linked to that of missing schoolboy, Miguel Louw. According to TimesLive, veteran cop Rajan Govender‚ of the city’s organised crime unit‚ had visited the scene where the decomposed body of a boy was found in Phoenix on Monday. He is the same detective who handled the murder of slain escort, Siam Lee. Miguel was last seen on July 17 in the presence of Mohammed Ebrahim who has been charged with his abduction. Ebrahim, who is still in prison as he has been unable to post the R2500 bail, lives about 100 metres from where the body of a young boy was found in Longbury Drive in Phoenix on Monday. According to TimesLIVE, police sources with knowledge of the investigation‚ said that Govender had taken the reins of the Miguel Louw case. The case has changed hands several times. Govender was part of a team of police officers who examined the scene on Monday‚ working with forensic investigators who combed the dumpsite for evidence. Daily News
