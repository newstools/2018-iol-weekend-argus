Cape Town - The recent cold fronts may have brought discomfort for some, but overall, they have brought relief to many. "Dam levels have improved by 0.9% over the last week to 70% of storage capacity," the City of Cape Town said in a press release on Monday. "The average water consumption for the past week declined from 526 million litres per day to 505 million litres per day. "Last week the City of Cape Town announced that it would lower water restrictions and tariffs from Level 6 to Level 5 from 1 October 2018 due to the encouraging dam recovery and the ongoing conservation efforts by Capetonians. "As usage has never reached the target of 450 million under Level 6b restrictions and has hovered around 500 million litres per day, which is the target for Level 5 restrictions, the City decided to lower the restriction and tariff to Level 5. This will provide some financial relief to water users and this should reflect in the October municipal accounts. "Tariffs are based on consumption, thus lower usage leads to lower costs. "The City encourages its water users to continue conserving water to ensure that Cape Townâ€™s dams recover adequately for the summer months ahead," the City said. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus * This story forms part of the #HighSchoolsQuiz study material.
