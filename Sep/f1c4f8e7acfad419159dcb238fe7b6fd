Cape Town - Watching Swerfgoed can feel disorientating with the cast seemingly jumping from one timeline to the next and as an audience, you’ll probably walk out of the theatre not knowing what just happened or what you watched. But through the confusion comes a laugh a minute play about a dystopia set sometime in the near future where there’s no water and people will do anything to get their hands this most precious of commodities. The ominous signs and relevance to Cape Town speak for itself with the city still recovering and managing one of its worst droughts. The play centres on the inhabitants of the little Motel Stillewater, situated on some godforsaken stretch of land sans water. Murder, madness, and laughter ensue as Anna-Mart van der Merwe, Nicole Holm, Richard September and Andrew Laubscher put on a 90-minute drama for an intimate Baxter audience. The cast plays multiple characters throughout the play and seems to be jumping in and out of different timelines. Holm is a particular joy to watch while September is brilliant, often playing two roles at the same time. Music is used to great effect during scene and timeline changes, which helps to distract from a lull and also gives the audience a chance to absorb their last few minutes.  Swergoed is in Afrikaans so your language skills will have to be sharp to follow along with the fast-paced dialogue and throwaway one-liners that are superb if you catch them. Much has been said of Swerfgoed winning awards earlier this year at the KKNK Festival and I’m not sure it warrants those awards but despite the confusion and incoherence of the plot, the play is a thoroughly entertaining night at the theatre. Swerfgoed runs at the Baxter Golden Arrow Studio until September 22. Ticket prices range from R80 to R130 and are available through Webtickets. Weekend Argus
