Built as a hotel in 1895, it was named the Metropole until it was bought around 12 years ago. The original architect of the Grand Daddy hotel building on 38 Long Street was Mello Gerardus Damstra, a Dutchman who came to the Cape around 1895. As you enter the hotel you immediately get the vintage feel with the reception desk made out of old vintage suitcases and in the foyer an old trunk is used as a table. With guests from far and wide, the hotel’s front office manager Faeez Abrahams said it is normally the Germans and the Swiss who enjoy the history of the establishment. “They always ask questions about the CBD and the hotel. They are not the only ones though, some locals come into the hotel just to see the elevator and take a selfie in front of it. People really enjoy the elevator - it is a big attraction here.” The hotel, which has 33 rooms, didn’t always have this look. Abrahams said it was revamped in 2015 and it was decided that the fancy stuff should go and the heritage be brought back. Another attraction at the hotel is the rooftop bar, which has Airstream trailers. “People hear about the bar and the trailers and then they want to come and check it out,’’Abrahams said.
