Three days of rain has seen dam levels in the Western Cape surge to a combined level of 72.7% after starting the week at 70%. According to City of Cape Town statistics on Thursday, dam levels have increased to such a degree that both the Clanwilliam and Berg River dams broke the 100% mark this week. It has been a week of extremes, with snow flurries on Table Mountain on Wednesday. The Steenbras Upper (95.8%), Wemmershoek (93.6%), Steenbras Lower (92.6%) and Voëlvlei (87.2) dams are also edging towards the 100% mark. Cape Town's main supply dam, Theewaterskloof, is at 54.% of its capacity, with hopes it can break the 60% mark before summer. The opening of the sluice gates of the Clanwilliam Dam in the Olifants River Valley also brought cheer on social media and much-needed relief to the drought-stricken farming community on the West Coast.      "That means that the sluices can be opened so there's more water for the agriculture sector. In the Western Cape, the agriculture sector provides a lot of jobs so it leads to economic growth which is always good." The dam levels of the Berg River (3.4%), Wemmershoek (3.6%), Steenbras Lower (4.9%) and Theewaterskloof (2.4%) all rose in the past three days, while the Steenbras Upper remained unchanged and the Voelvlei declined by 1.5%.
