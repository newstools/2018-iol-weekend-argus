Chirrime, 45, left a troubled family life and home in Mozambique and headed for the coastal and sometimes wet weather of Cape Town in the hope of finding better artistic opportunities. Though art is big in her home country, there are limited opportunities for exposure. “Unfortunately we don’t have much support, exposure or market”, she said. The single mother of two told Weekend Argus that her art was a depiction of “what my eyes see and my soul feels”. “It comes from the daily events I come across and it's my interpretation of the bright side of the struggle, black tears, freedom of expression and happiness within the soul.” Her art is made of interwoven materials to describe the internal battles she lives with, namely, identity and self-acceptance. Her passion for fabrics helped her transcend her dislike for the Cape’s wet winters; she said her misery in winter soon faded when she realised it was bound to return every year. She forced herself to accept and embrace it, and this gave rise to her heavier arts. Chirrime never received a formal arts education. In 2004 she held her first solo exhibition in Mozambique and in 2005 she accepted a three-month residency at Greatmore Studios in Cape Town. She creates large-scale textile-driven works on canvas that consist of abstract forms rendered in a collage of printed fabrics. “These abstract forms evoke the human body and my identity-responsive practice where I transcend a painful upbringing that left me shattered and broken. I literally ‘re-stitched’ myself together.” Chirrime’s latest solo exhibition, The forms of the invisible demand, opened at the Worldart Gallery in Church Street, Cape Town, on September 6 and runs until September 27.
