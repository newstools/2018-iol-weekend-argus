Pretoria - Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa has died after a short illness, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Saturday. Molewa, 61, passed away at a Pretoria hospital on Saturday, he said in a statement. “I offer my deepest condolences to the family of minister Edna Molewa as well as to her colleagues in cabinet and across all spheres of government who have had the privilege to work alongside an extraordinary leader of our people. “This is a devastating loss to our nation and to the global community who owe a great debt of gratitude to the late minister Molewa for her championship nationally and globally for the environmental integrity of a sustainable planet Earth that can be shared and enjoyed by all nations and all people, rich and poor. “Minister Molewa has distinguished herself in many capacities and causes from her contribution to our liberation to fighting for equality of women in our society. We shall miss her greatly,” he said.
