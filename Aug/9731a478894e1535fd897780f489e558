  Cape Town
  - DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela has called on national government to deploy additional resources to the 
  
   
    
     Western Cape 
    
   
  to ensure commuters have access to "better and safer trains". Speaking at an oversight inspection conducted by the DA at 
  
   
    
     
      Cape Town
     
    
   
   station today, Madikizela said the safety of rail passengers remained the party's number one priority and should be the focus of all efforts towards a functioning rail system. "The DA-led Western Cape and City of Cape Town have gone above and beyond to provide additional safety measures for passengers, it is now up to national government to support our efforts by providing additional resources," said Madikizela.  Madikizela also lambasted the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) for operating without valid safety permits. “This is serious violation of our citizen’s right to use public transport safely. The fact that a public service like PRASA, which is supposed to help people with their daily commute, is unable to ensure that its service is safe to use is shocking.” He added that under a DA national government, "we would delegate the safety of train infrastructure, commuters and staff to the metro government as clearly the current government is unable to properly manage and operate the rail system". @CapeTimesSA ctnews@inl.co.za Cape Times
