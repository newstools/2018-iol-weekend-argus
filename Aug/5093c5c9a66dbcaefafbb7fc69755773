Pravin Gordhan has become a law unto himself. “He founded an illegal and rogue unit at Sars and he has continued to employ his children, friends and associates in government entities at the expense of the people who voted the ANC to power,” says Shezi. He says that Gordhan was directing Transnet board chairman Popo Molefe and his board to suspend Siyabonga Gama as CEO “despite impressive results and unproven allegations”. "He (Gordhan) wants to replace him (Gama) with lackeys who will capture Transnet on his behalf,” says Shezi. Daily News
