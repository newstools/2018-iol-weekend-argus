The child was found “distressed, sweating and with her nose running” in the back of a Toyota Avanza at around 11.30am with no parents in sight, said Principal Inspector Godfray Africa. Traffic officer Nontsikelelo Kalimani was first on the scene - her gentle demeanour quickly relaxed the panicking girl and after the back passenger-side window was broken, the girl was retrieved without injuries. It is believed the adults looking after the child were attending a church gathering led by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, though those responsible for the girl have yet to be identified. Africa said the girl may have been trapped in the car for most of the morning. Africa praised Kalimani, commenting that her rapid response had saved the child. @peter197t  peter.thomas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
