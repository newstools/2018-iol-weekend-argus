Cape Town - Outgoing Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille may have resigned, but this doesn't mean she has escaped all charges against her. De Lille agreed to resign as mayor of the Mother City, and the DA agreed not to pursue any disciplinary charges against her. But that doesn't mean the charges brought against her in the city council fall away. The forensic investigation by law firm Bowmans is still under way. Bowmans was to establish if disciplinary action should be taken against one or more of Cape Town’s senior managers - Achmat Ebrahim, the former City manager; Melissa Whitehead, commissioner of transport and urban development; and Craig Kesson, executive director in the Directorate of the mayor. It also dealt with De Lille's conduct; her computers were seized and later returned as part of the investigation earlier this year. After more than 10 months of mudslinging and court cases, the wrangling between the DA and De Lille appears to be over. De Lille loses the mayoral chains, but retains her DA membership, and the party has dropped all internal charges against her. DA leader Mmusi Maimane and De Lille appeared at a press conference together, announcing the decision at the weekend. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
