Cape Town - The City of Cape Town has approved the training and deployment of 100 law enforcement officers to protect rail infrastructure which has come under attack in and around the city in the last few weeks. Mayoral committee members on Wednesday approved the deployment of officers at the end of September, which will come at a cost of R48 million. The set-up cost of R48m for the new metro police unit is being shared equally by Prasa, the City and the provincial government. Part of it is to provide vehicles and equipment, while around R25m is expected to be used for staffing costs - which will include the recruitment of fully-fledged peace officers who will be able to do arrests. JP Smith, mayoral committee member for safety, security and social services, said: “The recruitment of staff is well-underway. We also used existing staff to make an impact on the vandalism and sabotage on the rail system.” Brett Herron, mayoral committee for urban development and transport, said the solution to the relentless attacks on rail infrastructure needs an integrated approach. “We see now that Metrorail has about 37 train sets while 88 are needed. That is a fraction of the capacity that they had. We now know that many commuters have moved on to road transport and that is why we have seen the dramatic increase in congestion,” he said. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
