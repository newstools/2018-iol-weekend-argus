Durban - KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner, has slammed police union, Popcru, for what he calls “baseless allegations” made by the police union over comments he had made regarding grievances within the police force. Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi said he was surprised by Popcru’s sentiments more especially as they had not bothered to verify the allegations. According to Mkhwanazi, during his interaction with police officers, it emerged that many employees were aggrieved due to the lack of opportunities for promotions. In response to those concerns, Mkhwanazi shared his views with police officials on how he saw the career pathing for police officials should be directed. KZN police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker, said it was later brought to their attention that Mkhwanazi’s comments had been taken out of context. “These misconstrued comments were  inciting discord amongst members of the police. An internal communique has been issued to police officers in the province to put the matter in the correct context,” Naicker said. He added that a meeting will take place between Mkhwanazi and the unions to set the record straight. Naicker said once that has taken place, Popcru can convey Mkhwanazi’s message to their members. Mkhwanazi said in his 17 years as a commissioned police officer, he has presided over a number of posts and have appointed many civilians into the department. “Last year, I motivated for the appointment of interns into the police force which saw more than 300 youth being appointed into administrative positions within the SAPS. Some of those I have appointed have progressed and are occupying senior positions and some have become very good police officers which makes me proud,” he said. Mkhwanazi said the allegations that he had issues with police clerks were unfortunate. “These could only have been made by those who have a personal agenda against me,” he said. Daily News
