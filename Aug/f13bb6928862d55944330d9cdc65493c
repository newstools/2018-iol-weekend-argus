Cape Town - Imagine being a 16-year-old from Cape Town and you and get the chance to work with Grammy Award winning producers. Desmond John, now 19, got his chance working with Kendrick Dean, Lil Ronnie, K Fam and five times Grammy Award winner Kuk Harrell and now he has released his single, I Mean That. The release of I Mean That also follows John’s tour in the UK during January and February this year where he performed at various venues across the country. “Originally I Mean That started off with a single guitar riff, which I recorded as a voice note on my phone. I then went into the studio and started singing the first verse. It’s about someone that I had been seeing at the time and this was the best way I could describe how I was feeling about it.” Describing his style of music, John says it is a fusion of R&B, Jazz and Hip-Hop, which gives his songs a definitive sound. He plays both guitar and piano but usually composes on guitar. He adds: “I always write the melody first and then shape the lyrics around it. Reason is that people remember the melody before the words when they hear a song for the first time, so I do my utmost to make sure they won’t forget what they’ve heard when listening to my songs,” John and his family relocated to South Africa from Germany when he was four-years-old. The family first came to Johannesburg before moving to Cape Town when he was 13-years-old. He was playing football and was scouted to go and play soccer for an academy in Munich, Germany for a year. “I decided to come back for two reasons. I was really homesick and I realised that I didn’t want to pursue a football career,” he said. Six months later, a chance meeting in a studio in Johannesburg led to Desmond John moving to Atlanta in America. Weekend Argus
