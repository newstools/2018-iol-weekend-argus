The march was part of the 10th Women Humanity Walk that started in the Bo-Kaap on Women's Day. It was also in remembrance of the 20000 women who marched to the Union Buildings more than 60 years ago to protest against the apartheid pass laws. Artscape chief executive Marlene le Roux said the walk formed part of the Artscape’s Women’s Humanity Arts Festival. “Over 60 years ago more than 20000 women marched to the Union Buildings in Pretoria to protest against the pass laws. August 9 was the historic day those women marched. Today this day is called National Women’s Day. The women’s festival is dedicated to iconic women who led the Struggle. “These include Albertina Sisulu, whose centenary year is being celebrated; Ruth First; and modern-day activists Lee Ann van Rooi, Siphokazi Jonas and the late, disabled activist Patience Lunika. Today women are judged on what they wear, and many are subjected to violence, partner abuse and femicide,” Le Roux said. Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille also marched and said the Artscape festival brought people from different backgrounds together. “This goes together in building an inclusive city. “It is up to all of us to tackle the challenges, especially those affecting the most vulnerable in society, and to empower our grandmothers, mothers, sisters and daughters to be able to take care of themselves and claim their rights,” she said. Fatima Solomons, 52, from Belhar, who attended the women’s festival, said she had enjoyed it. “It has been a great day for me. Otherwise I would have just be at home doing nothing. “It is also the first time in my life that I have visited Artscape. As women we need more days like these,” she said. @RusanaPhilander Cape Argus
