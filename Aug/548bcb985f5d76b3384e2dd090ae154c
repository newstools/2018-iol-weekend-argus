What was also a welcome treat, was the casting of Daniel Mpilo Richards as Shakespeare, who had evident on-stage chemistry with Roxane Hayward who played female lead Lady Viola de Lesseps. Richards replaces Dylan Edy from last year and brings much energy and cheekiness to the role. The stage production is based on the Academy Award-winning film of the same name and was presented at the Fugard last year. Shakespeare in Love is a play within a play - the audience sees how Shakespeare writes and stages Romeo and Juliet, amid power struggles and a myriad of setbacks. He finds himself in a tryst with Lady Viola, who sneaks her way into the production pretending to be a man. Their love story begins to inspire the production as Viola ducks between her home life and betrothal to Lord Wessex (Jason K Ralph) and her secret identity as actor Thomas Kent in rehearsals. Shakespeare in Love is a fun romp with moments of reflection on the texts of Shakespeare while examining the role of theatre at the time. CapeTalk presenter Maytham returns to this production as Fennyman, a hilarious but dour character. Fennyman is a ruthless funder of the play, who scores a tiny role. Maytham makes a fun sideshow out of the character through sitcom-like timing. A dose of animal cuteness comes from Spot (the Dog) played by agile canine Bogart. This pooch runs on and off stage for a few scenes and is a heart-stealer. Also look out for the performance of Robyn Scott who plays an effervescent Queen Elizabeth. Her eye-rolling and head-turning lampoons the indignation of royalty. Her performance is as large as the showâ€™s costumes. * Tickets cost from R150 to R350 and can be booked through the Fugard Theatre box office at 021 461 4554 or at www.thefugard.com.
