Kim Kardashian West slams sister Kourtney Kardashian in a sneak peek of the upcoming season of 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians'. Kim is heard yelling at Kourtney during a heated argument about scheduling a photo shoot. “Get the f**k out of here and go. No one wants you in the f**king shoot. I’m planning the shoot so we don’t want you in the shoot.” Kourtney hit back, “Did I already say this morning I don’t care to do it?” Kim continued bashing her older sister, “Good, then don’t be in it. You’re so f**king annoying. Perfect. Shut the f** up.” Kris Jenner steps in, shouting at Kourtney “You are annoying, Kourtney”. The KKW Beauty founder then shifts gears and start criticising Kourtney's professional life. “Maybe if you had a f**king business that you were passionate about then you would know what it takes to run a f**king business, but you don’t. So don’t even act like you know what I’m talking about.”   Kris then chimes in, “Kourtney, you just have a way of rubbing people the wrong way.” It's clear Kourtney had heard enough, she marched out of the house with Kim shouting “Kourtney is out. She won’t be at the shoot because she is the one that has the annoying schedule. I can’t handle this anymore because everyone is dropping left and right from all these schedule changes. I need Kourtney to not be so f**king annoying with a stick up her ass like she runs this s**t because she doesn’t. She’s the least exciting to look at.” Keeping Up With The Kardashians season 15 on August 5, on E! Entertainment
