  - UCT Vice-Chancellor Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng has responded to the inflammatory, racist and sexist Facebook rant by a staff member, calling the posts "deeply disturbing". The lecturer at the centre of the controversy, Arthur Mabentsela, works in the university’s Department of Chemical Engineering. Earlier this week, he caused an uproar on social media after he made comments which included an attack on women who used the phrase “#MenAreTrash”, intended to expose incidents of sexual abuse and violence. Phakeng confirmed that Mabentsela had been removed from teaching prior to the messages he posted. “In accordance with the university’s human resources policy and labour legislation, a pre-suspension meeting took place this afternoon. The staff member involved had the right to attend the meeting with a union member or an employee representative of his choice. This meeting was concluded and the staff member, according to due process, made his representation on why he should not be suspended,” Phakeng said. She added that the university made the decision not to suspend the staff member, but to place him on a compulsory leave of absence on medical grounds. “I want to assure staff, students and parents that we are urgently acting on this matter because we recognise its importance. We continuously strive for, and remain committed to, creating and maintaining a climate on campus that is aligned with the values of UCT, which includes upholding the dignity of all people,” added Phakeng.
