CAPE TOWN - It seems to be an open secret that Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane and presenter Robert Marawa are not on the best of terms, but their rumoured "feud" reached new levels on Saturday as they combined to produce two of the most awkard interviews ever seen at a PSL match. In the first, a pre-match chat on the field at Loftus Versfeld, where Sundowns took on Kaizer Chiefs in the first game of the new season, Mosimane seemed reluctant to provide any comprehensive answers to Marawa's questions. But it was the second interview, after the game finished in a 1-1 draw, that really got tongues wagging on social media. After Marawa has finished with his post-match questions, Mosimane asked the presenter about the Man of the Match award that had just been presented to Khama Billiat.Â "Can I ask who chooses the Man of the Match. Is it SMSs like in the Shell Cup? Who chooses the Man of the Match?" Mosimane said. After Marawa had informed him that the commentators had selected Billiat as the MOTM and enquired why Mosimane had asked him, the Sundowns boss simply replied with "What did he do?" before walking off screen. The interaction and Billiat winning the award seemed to divide PSL fans on social media. Many agreed that Billiat deserved the award while others suggested that the former Sundowns player's reputation had preceded him and that there were more deserving candidates. And while some accused Mosimane of behaving unprofessionally, others suggested that the broadcaster should assign a new presenter to Sundowns games. While we may never know the truth behind rumours that two of South Africa's biggest football personalities are fueding, it does make for excellent social media fodder.                                                                            @LiamCPT IOL Sport   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
