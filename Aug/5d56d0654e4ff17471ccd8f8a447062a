  - Moulana Shaykh Ihsaan Hendricks al-Nadwi, former Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) leader and prominent Islamic scholar, passed away on Friday after a long illness. He was 54. In a statement issued by human rights and 
 
  Palestine
  solidarity organisation, BDS South Africa, Professor Farid Esack called Hendricks “a giant in the international Islamic scholarly community, a friend to the Palestinian people, an activist in the 
 
  Palestine
  solidarity movement and a supporter of the BDS boycott of 
 
  
   Israel
  
  campaign”. “Hendricks was crucial in getting South African Muslims to see that while they should be inspired by their religious values (of justice and equality) to fight for the liberation of Palestine that that struggle and providing solidarity was not one essentially about Muslims but one of justice for all Palestinians regardless of faith (or none). “He was an ally of Muslims, Christians and Jews; whoever was oppressed! He was a supporter of justice across the board,” Esack said. The ANC also issued condolences to the Hendricks family, calling the late leader a "scholar and an activist in the 
  
   
    Palestine
   
   solidarity movement."  In a statement, ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe said that Hendricks was a leader whose contribution would "forever be recognised as part of our history". "He dedicated his life to the fight for the liberation of the people of 
  
   Palestine
   and was a supporter of the BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions] boycott of 
  
   
    Israel
   
   campaign," said Mabe.   Social media has been awash with tributes to Hendricks since news of his death first broke.    Internationally, he was a leading member of the International Muslim Scholars Council and founder of the Al Quds Foundation in 
   
    
     South Africa,
    
    which focused on both moral and material support for the Palestinian struggle. @capetimes  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
