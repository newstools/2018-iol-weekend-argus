Cape Town - The DA has launched a legal bid to overturn the ousting of Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip. DA leader Mmusi Maimane addressed the media following a vote in the Nelson Mandela Bay council that saw Trollip and Speaker Jonathan Lewack removed from their positions on Monday. Maimane said that in 2016 the DA-led coalition government consisting of coalition partners DA, ACDP, COPE, and UDM – and later the PA - set out to eradicate corruption, deliver basic services and ensure people of Nelson Mandela Bay were able to find work. “Throughout the challenges faced, we have seen many successes and shown real progress in delivering services to the people of NMB,” Maimane said. Maimane said the ANC, UDM and EFF had effectively formed a unity coalition. “The people of Nelson Mandela Bay witnessed the newly formed coalition of corruption between the ANC, UDM and EFF banding together to undermine the will of the electorate by unlawfully removing its duly elected DA-led coalition government. This was a mock council meeting that elected a mock government, and we are of the view that yesterday’s proceedings are invalid in law,” he said. Trollip said the ANC and EFF’s action were illegal and that they are confident of overturning their decisions. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
