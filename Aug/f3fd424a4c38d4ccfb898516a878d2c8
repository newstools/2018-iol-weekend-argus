 Through the power of social media, the campaign provided each nominee with a platform for their accolades to be lauded; but in the end, the work of one exceptional woman stood out. Stephanie Benjamin of Steph’s Ladles of Love was the overall winner of the campaign, thanks to her ambition to “feed our nation with love and kindness”.Using the hashtag #SyHerrit, the campaign has been a platform for recognising ordinary women who do extraordinary things in the lives of their communities – often without any recognition for their contributions. Despite being acknowledged as the woman who embodied the #SyHerrit brand best, Benjamin said she never expected to win an award for her work, which she described as being part of her “humanity”. “When I heard I was nominated, I thanked the universe for using me as a vessel to make a difference in people’s lives. Whether it’s a good word or positive thought you out out, that’s a donation in someone’s life,” Benjamin said.
