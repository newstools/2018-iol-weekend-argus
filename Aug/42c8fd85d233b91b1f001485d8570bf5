Cape Town - Thousands gathered at a Cape Town church on Saturday for the last leg of Parliament’s public hearings into land expropriation without compensation. Picture: @Our_DA/Twitter People from all across the city attended the hearings, but the central focus was on the need for housing, land, food security and the compensation of land owners.    “Let me tell you as a South African, I am not happy with the land ownership in South Africa. I want it to change; but that change does not require changing the Constitution but changing the government,” Maimane said flanked by provincial and regional leaders.    Mercia Andrews said: “I support this motion because we need land for agricultural use. There are black farmers who do not get recognition. We are seeing people evicted off their land and there are no actions taken against white farmers,” she said. The committee is set to report back to Parliament in September with recommendations - after which a final decision will be made. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
