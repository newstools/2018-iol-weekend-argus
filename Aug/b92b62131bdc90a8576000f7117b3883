State prosecutor Thabo Ntela argued for a harsh sentence for convicted rapist and murderer Odwa Nkololo on Monday. He was found guilty on two rape counts, from separate complainants, plus the murder of Iyapha. Iyapha went missing while playing outside her aunt’s home. Her body was found stuffed in a plastic bag the following day, on April 30 last year. A month before, Nkololo raped a close friend’s 7-year-old daughter. The mother and the child testified. The court said it appeared as if the mother was protecting Nkololo by influencing the child to give a watered-down version of the rape incident. He was linked to the crimes by DNA evidence: semen, blood and hair strands. Both incidents took place in Town Two, Khayelitsha. Ntela said Nkololo had no substantial and compelling circumstances for the court to hand down a lesser sentence. “The accused has shown no remorse and was barbaric in his deeds. No lesser sentence would be appropriate in the above matter,” he said. Defence advocate Susanna Kuun argued that Nkololo had a child, and was a person who could keep a job. She said the income from his employment would be needed in providing for his child. Ntela further argued that the community needed to see justice done. “The personal circumstances of the accused should not be seen as an excuse to commit brutal, gross and severe unlawful acts. “The accused may be a first offender, but it doesn’t excuse his behaviour. “It may be said that the accused deserves a second chance in life, but what about the deceased, who lost her life, and the family that lost a daughter and sister? “What about the victim who has her life destroyed with the traumatic and heinous act committed by the accused?” he said. Nkololo will be sentenced on Tuesday. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
