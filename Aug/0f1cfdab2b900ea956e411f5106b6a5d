DURBAN - A Durban legal eagle has been selected as the "Real Hero" of the We Are Durban campaign, which celebrates the city's heroes during Women's Month. We Are Durban helps charities in the eThekwini area to reach their potential, by helping them use a developmental approach to give back instead of a relief type approach. Charmaine Schwenn, the director of Durban-based law firm Schwenn Inc. has been using her skills to help develop the city's residents. She was nominated as a "Real Hero" for her active involvement in pro-bono work, including assisting ProBono.org. Schwenn has served on the Jes Foord Foundation, which assists survivors of rape, and was recently appointed as the Small Claims Court Commissioner to provide access to justice to those who cannot afford the court process. “I am both honoured and humbled to be recognised and salute all fellow women in business this Women’s month," said Schwenn. We Are Durban’s managing director, Linda Morrison, said they aimed to highlight local and inspiring women within the various organisations they represent. "These women challenge us to be more than we have been in the past and are changing their community for the better. We value our Real Heroes who are hope carriers, impact champions and change agents. Charmaine is a regular speaker at events motivating fellow businesswomen and encouraging them to succeed in their chosen fields. With a heart for upliftment and empowerment, she is deeply committed to volunteering and actively involved in multiple organisations," said Morrison. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
