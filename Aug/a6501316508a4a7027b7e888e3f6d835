The Duchess of Sussex displayed her enviable pins in a tuxedo dress on Wednesday night as she attended her first public engagement for more than a month. Meghan, who has not undertaken official duties since she and Prince Harry attended a charity polo match on July 26, was at a gala performance of the musical Hamilton in London with her husband in aid Sentebale, a charity he helped set up for people affected by HIV in southern Africa. Former actress Meghan was wearing a short £450 ( about R8 488) tuxedo dress by Canadian label Judith & Charles, with a pair of Paul Andrew stilettos. It is the third time she has seen the award-winning production. It tells the story of one of America’s founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant from the West Indies who was George Washington’s right-hand man. It is believed she first watched it in New York with one of her closest friends, actress Priyanka Chopra, and then again in February this year with Harry. Ironically, Hamilton pokes fun at George III, who is portrayed as a comical character. Daily Mail
