Cape Town - It was a stressful start to Friday for many residents of Cape Town, who spent extra time on their commute into the CBD. Rail commuters, by now used to regular delays, were held back even further by at least two major problems, which caused even further problems. On the Northern line, there were delays of 20 to 30 minutes along the Wellington service "due to speed restrictions, low overhead power between Huguenot and Malan, manual authorisation of trains at Wellington and sets out of service", Metrorail tweeted.      There were further problems on the Cape Flats line: "#CapeFlatsLineCT Vandalism, sets out of service and infrastructure problems at Hazendal and Pinelands. Delays of 20-30mins."      Train sets were also out of service on the Southern line: "#SouthernLineCT #Cancellation T0133 - 07:38 - Cape Town to Fish Hoek and T0154 - 08:49 - Fish Hoek to Cape town - sets out of service. Expect delays."      Protest action at the busy intersection of Duinefontuin road and Govan Mbeki road caused several long delays. "Protest Action Govan Mbeki Road and Duinefontein Road. Tyres set alight in the intersection. Govan Mbeki Road Eastbound closed at Vygekraal Road and Duinefontein Road Southbound closed at George Street," the City of Cape Town's Richard Coleman said. "Govan Mbeki Road westbound closed from Edward Makele Road (NY72)," he said. The fires were eventually extinguished and the debris cleared from the roadway, but the effects were still being felt well into morning peak. There were also a number of delays on the city's major highways, the M5, N1 and N2, as well as a broken down vehicle on Philip Kgosana Drive.                * Feel free to keep us updated with what's happening in peak hour traffic by tagging us in your tweets and Facebook posts. @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
