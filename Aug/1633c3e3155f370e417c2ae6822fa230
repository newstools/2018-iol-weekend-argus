Cape Town - Golden Arrow Bus Services (Gabs) has suspended its service in Khayelitsha indefinitely after two of its vehicles were torched, while a third was also attacked. Gabs spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said two buses were set alight in Khayelitsha, while a third attempt was made in Delft. As a result, there would be no service in Khayelitsha, while the service in Delft would only operate on the outskirts of the suburb. "Golden Arrow Bus Services can confirm that two of our buses were set a light in Khayelitsha, and a third attempt was made in Delft earlier this (Monday) morning," Dyke-Beyer said. "Unfortunately, that means we are not operating in Khayelitsha at all, and we are operating from the outskirts of Delft and Nyanga. "We are keeping a very close eye on the situation and will do everything possible to keep everyone informed," she said. @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
