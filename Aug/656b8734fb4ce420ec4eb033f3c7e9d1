Chianti is produced in central Italy's Tuscany region, but in 2013, a US cinema chain, Alamo Drafthouse, released a series of Silence of the Lambs-inspired wines. (We're not quite sure just how well they pair with human liver, though.)  UB40's Red, Red Wine is probably the most iconic and well-known of wine songs. The original, sang by crooner Neil Diamond, was given a Jamaican-rock do-over when the boys from UB40 reclaimed the song in the late-1980's and turned it into a wine-lover's anthem.   Isn't it ironic... that Alanis Morissette sings about “a black fly in your Chardonnay,” in her 1995 pop rock classic song, Ironic? And who could forget the catchy lyrics to 2001's Lady Marmalade, in which Lil’ Kim, Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink and Missy Elliot belt out: “Boy drank all that magnolia wine..." and "We drink wine with diamonds in the glass.” The hit TV show Will and Grace featured the character of the fabulous Karen Walker, who made no qualms about her penchant for boxed wine. Classy! Similarly, Eddie and Patsy's preferred tipple of choice - wine (and copious amounts of it), saw the Absolutely Fabulous duo become the poster women for day drinking to an entire generation. But it's ultimately Paul Giamatti’s single, throwaway line – “I am not drinking f@*!ing merlot!” in the 2004 movie sideways, which is probably the most significant pop culture reference when it comes to all things wine.
