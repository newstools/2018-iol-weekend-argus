SAS Galeshwe would operate close to the coastline, while the SAS Protea would work further into sea thus covering a greater area than they would individually, Moraille said. “Despite the fact that no arrests were made, this operation does send a warning to any criminal element that the SA Navy is ready to protect its territorial waters, as well as those of its neighbours.
