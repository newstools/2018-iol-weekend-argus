This comes after areas such as Tafelsig and Beacon Valley were identified as red-zone areas for paramedics. In the past, paramedics have been attacked and robbed in areas. Community worker Joanie Fredericks, who initiated the project, said it was important for the community to start working with the emergency services because if they did not get to patients in time, people could die. “Because an area such as Tafelsig is a red zone, the ambulance services first have to go to the police station to be escorted into the area,” she said. Ceceline Seale, 55, from Tafelsig, who completed the emergency response training, said: “We now know what to do when a stabbing happens. The paramedics taught us that ‘you should not take a knife out from a person who was stabbed, because they can bleed to death’. The training is going to help us save a person’s life before the ambulance comes,” she said. The 63-year-old Catherine van Rooyen, who also completed the training, said she enjoyed the training. One of the paramedics who conducted the training, Abdul Martin, said he was proud of the women. “We trained them to resuscitate people, treat knife and gunshot wounds,” he said. @RusanaPhilander rusanaphilander1@gmail.com Cape Argus
