A Hangberg resident has allegedly been shot during a raid, with two suspects being arrested and automatic weapons seized. The arrests were triggered after a flying squad car allegedly came under fire. This led to police reportedly shooting the owner of the house. Subsequently, the police were alleged to have found firearms and crayfish in the house. This at a time when the Hangberg community is still on edge after Sunday's violent protests, while police divers continued their search for missing fisherman Durick van Blerk in Hout Bay harbour on Thursday. The Van Blerk family had called for the police to be allowed to do their job without interference and for the community to desist from protesting. Van Blerk has been missing after he went overboard following an alleged altercation with an anti-poaching unit, when he and two others were prevented from allegedly fishing for crayfish illegally. The photographs of Van Blerk’s rubber duck, taken at Table Bay police station after the incident, allegedly showed multiple bullet holes through the engine and pontoons.
