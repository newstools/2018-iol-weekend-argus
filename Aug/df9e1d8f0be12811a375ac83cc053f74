Give her a pen and paper and she will produce stories - words that make you think, laugh and sometimes cry. She is a born storyteller. Maartensâ€™s latest book is perfect for reading aloud or quietly to oneself. The author told the group of Grade 5s how her book was stuck onboard a container ship last year when it should have been on shop shelves. Now we can expect it to be a stocking filler in December. The book, Chris and the Christmas Angel, is beautifully illustrated by Anneliese Voigt-Peters, a South African living in the US. It tells of a friendship between a boy and a security guard who is willing to teach the eight-year-old about the stars. Maartens writes in Afrikaans, but her work is translated into English and Xhosa. She read her account of the lion from Die Leeu Wat Drukkies Gee en ander ware Diereverhale, translating for the pupils as she read. Generous with her time, Maartens also had an exclusive question and answer session with members of the Woodbridge Primary Grade 5 book and comic clubs. They were urged to continue reading and writing for pleasure. - JBJ Reporter
