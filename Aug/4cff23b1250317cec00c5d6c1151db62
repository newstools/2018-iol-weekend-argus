Cape Town - A concerned resident of Hout Bay has launched a crowdfunding campaign in support of the family of missing fisherman Durick van Blerk. His disappearance sparked outrage in the community of Hangberg, in Hout Bay, with many residents accusing the police of shooting him dead while he was out fishing in the early hours of Saturday morning. Van Blerk has not been seen since, but the dinghy he and two colleagues were fishing in was allegedly found riddled with bullets. Van Blerk's girlfriend is due to give birth to their child soon, and to support her and the baby, Athea Katzeff. "Durick was shot while crayfishing on Sunday 12 August, trying to make some extra money to help his family," she wrote on the popular crowdfunding website BackaBuddy. "My fundraising is not a political statement; it is merely the support from one resident to another. "Durick was widely known as a 'good guy' and is a descendent of one of the oldest fishing families of Hout Bay," she wrote. "The funds raised will cover the birth of Durickâ€™s unborn baby and to help raise the child that would otherwise be deprived of her father and his earnings that would otherwise have given her a better life than the one she faces." The fund has raised a little over R3 500 so far, with a goal of R50 000. You can donate to the cause here. @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
