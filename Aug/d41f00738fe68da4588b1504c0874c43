Taking to her Instagram story, Nyaba claims she’s got someone’s nudes. “I got your nudes", she posts, making her statement using a bee emoji.

This is not the first time that Nyaba has caused a frenzy on social media as just over a month ago, she sparked speculations about being AKA's side chick. Nyaba previously denied having a relationship with the local rapper, but later fuelled rumours by posting a picture of a red siren stating she was "gonna start posting receipts". She proceeded to post another snap that got tongues wagging where she was seen with a blanket on a couch and AKA's gold-certified placards were in the background. Tweeps were quick to put two and two together, digging up a picture of AKA at the same spot which seems to prove that she was in AKA's house. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, Nyaba's next message created more questions on Twitter streets. "I'm preparing Bryanston rat meat from my ex's crib for his queen and squad of skanks. They are coming over for dinner so I have 3 points presentation of their nudes set aside for entertainment" See Twitter reactions to Nicole's rant:
