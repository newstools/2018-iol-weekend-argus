Cape Town - National Women's Day should also be used to promote breastfeeding. That's the opinion of DA MPL Lorraine Botha. The member of the provincial legislature said breastfeeding is a "beautiful bond" between mother and child, and celebrating Women's Month in SA, all aspects of womanhood should be celebrated. This week is World Breasfeeding Week, with the theme: "Breastfeeding: Foundation of Life". "Breastfeeding is not a practise that is openly discussed as it still carries a lot of stigma. We only need look around the room to see grimacing faces when a mother breastfeeds her child in public," she said. "Mothers who are unable or choose not to breastfeed for various reasons are also supported," she said of the Western Cape health department's First 1000 Days project. "To date, 100% of the public health and 3 private birthing units in the Western Cape are accredited with Mother Baby Friendly Initiative status. "It is a known fact that breastfeeding holds remarkable nutritional value. Benefits include: * protecting the baby against respiratory and non-communicable diseases such as asthma and diabetes; * helping with the cognitive and physical development of the baby; * reducing instances of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome; * improving the babyâ€™s response to immunisations against Polio, Tetanus, Diptheria, and Haemophilus influenza "This beautiful, natural phenomenon also benefits the woman, or the mother, because among others it reduces the chance of developing breast and ovarian cancer. "We are fully aware that for some moms, breastfeeding might be difficult due to various complications, but we need to encourage our mothers to choose this option, seeing that it has all of these benefits and so much more," Botha said. @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
