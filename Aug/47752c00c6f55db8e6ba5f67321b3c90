Cape Town - A new addition to the Bloch family has brought light into their lives after the pain of having their matriarch, Rosalie Bloch, 84, and her husband Aubrey Jackson, 96, killed in their Rosebank home in May. Rosalie’s youngest son, Shaun Bloch, and his wife Suzanne welcomed little Skylar Anna-Rose Bloch into the world on July 31. In May, Shaun made the gruesome discovery of his mother and his stepfather, who had been murdered, and he still suffers flashbacks and receives counselling. “My wife and mother were very close, and she was ever present during the early parts of the pregnancy. Her loss was deeply felt throughout our family. Our baby’s birth has become a unifying factor in our family at a very difficult time, as was our mother for her seven children scattered around the world,” he said. The newest member of the Bloch clan carries the name of both her grandmothers, Suzanna (Anna) and Rosaline (Rose), said Shaun. Shaun said his brother, education expert Graeme Bloch, and his wife Cheryl Carolus met their niece for the first time last week. “Graeme was beaming when he met her and Skylar has just brought light into all our lives. “This comes as we have placed our mother’s home up for sale, and donated the contents, as it had been tainted by this senseless act,” he said. Shaun said the family had received little information in terms of progress and would seek to meet the investigating officer soon. Police believed that the crime was a burglary that escalated into murder but could not confirm at what time the victims were killed. Rosebank deputy community policing chairperson Am- rish Punwasi said that as far as he knew, no new information had surfaced. Police spokesperson Nolo- yiso Rwexana said the investigation into the double murder was continuing, with no new developments or arrests.
