Cape Town - Dam levels in the Western Cape have increased slightly over the past week, reaching an average level of 52%. Last year at this time dams were still at 29%. The dams feeding the City of Cape Town are standing at 58% (2017: 30%). Of continued concern is the situation in the Gouritz River catchment area which includes large sections of the Karoo, the Western Cape Government said. Dam levels there are at an average of just 18%. “We are quite concerned about the situation in the Karoo. Last week Oudtshoorn declared a local disaster with dam levels for the town standing at 30%. We are monitoring the situation and have sent provincial engineers and other experts to the area already to assess the situation and see what can be done to assist,” said Anton Bredell, MEC for Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning in the Western Cape. “We are urging all residents in the Greater Oudtshoorn area to use water wisely and to report all leaks and water challenges to their local municipality. Every drop is critical.” Bredell says across the province, the message to use water sparingly remains in place despite improved dam levels. “The system remains vulnerable and demand is sure to pick up in the coming summer months.” Major Dam Statistics: Theewaterskloof dam: 43% full this week (2017: 23%.
