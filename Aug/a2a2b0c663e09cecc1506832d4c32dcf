Cape Town - The City of Cape Town's Law Enforcement Department has commenced with the recruitment of 100 Rail Enforcement officers to form part of the newly-established and specialised Rail Enforcement Unit. The unit will focus on the safety and security of Metrorail commuters and infrastructure. "Our urban rail service is under siege with numerous arson attacks the past few weeks. The Rail Enforcement Unit must be operational as soon possible, and they must hit the ground running," said mayoral committee member for transport and urban development, Brett Herron. Since May 2015, Metrorail’s train fleet in the Western Cape has lost a staggering 149 carriages. "It is our rail commuters who suffer the most with longer travelling times, delays and cancelled trips," said Herron. The cost to establish and operate the unit for a period of 12 months is approximately R47.9 million and is jointly funded by the City, the Western Cape Government and PRASA. The unit will focus on commuter safety and vandalism, as well as on the theft of crucial Metrorail infrastructure and assets. The unit’s members will rely on technology and predictive analytics, and will support the South African Police Service to identify those who are involved in the illicit metals theft industry. @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
