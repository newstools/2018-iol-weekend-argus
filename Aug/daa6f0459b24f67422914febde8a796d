This is according to Mitchells Plain Community Police Forum (CPF) chairperson Abie Isaacs, who said there had been only one shooting last week. Goolam was suspended twice last year after 15 firearms disappeared from Mitchells Plain police station. Community leaders said he had previously proved that he could bring crime down dramatically. Isaacs said: “Brigadier Goolam knows how to deal with gangsterism in communities. During his suspension until recently the area had a massive escalation in crime and gang-related shootings. “During his absence morale among police officers was also low, but now that he is back, morale has increased. The brigadier is truly a people’s cop and loves working in the community. He is committed to bringing down the crime rate in Mitchells Plain.” Isaacs said the local safety structures were also happy that Goolam was back. “People know him as someone who serves the community, and as someone who would go on patrols at night with community members. After his return there is also a positive sense in the communities.” The deputy chairperson of the Mitchells Plain CPF, Ashley Potts, said local residents were happy that Goolam had been reinstated. Community worker Joanie Fredericks said that with Goolam at the helm, crime would drop dramatically in the area. Dr Randall Petersen, from the religious fraternity, said: “Brigadier Cass Goolam is a great station commissioner. He cares about the youth, and when crime occurred in the community, he would immediately respond.” @RusanaPhilander Cape Argus
