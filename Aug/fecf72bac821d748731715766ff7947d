In a matter of minutes, things went pear-shaped for Kaizer Chiefs playmaker Joseph Molangoane at the FNB Stadium on Saturday evening. The popular Molangoane had played a role in the opening goal for Amakhosi, scored by striker Dumisani Zuma in the 20th minute to put Chiefs 1-0 up against Free State Stars in the MTN8 quarter-final. Leonardo Castro scored a second goal soon after halftime, but then the incident happened... Molangoane went in on a challenge to win the ball ahead of Makhehlene Makhaula, and was too late. Makhaula made contact with the ball first, and unfortunately, his foot landed on Molangoane’s right ankle. The Chiefs midfielder writhed in pain immediately, and received treatment on the pitch. Players from both teams stood around stunned by the severity of the injury, and Molangoane was eventually taken off on a stretcher. Referee Victor Gomes did not issue Makhaula with any card. SuperSport presenter Carol Tshabalala said from pitch-side that the Chiefs medical team had confirmed the worst – Molangoane had sustained a broken ankle. It is a huge blow for the 30-year-old, who would’ve wanted to impress new Amakhosi coach Giovanni Solinas this season after the departure of Steve Komphela. “Tight” Molangoane was replaced by Bernard Parker.      INJURY: Molangoane badly hurt from that Makhaula tackle and replaced by Parker. Could be out for a very long time. #MTN8 #WafaWafa pic.twitter.com/yfVECoQKDX  — MTN8 Wafa Wafa! (@MTN8)
