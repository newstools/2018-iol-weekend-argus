Cape Town - Two police constables were killed in two separate incidents in Cape Town on Friday night, both while off-duty. The first incident occurred at the corner of Sarah Baartman and Symphony Way in Delft. Constable Lonwabo Kili (30), who was stationed at Bellville South Police Station, was shot dead while picking up an acquaintance shortly after 8pm. Later that evening, another off-duty officer, Mowbray SAPS-based Constable Siyamcela Ncipa (37), was shot twice in the head outside the residence of a friend in Site B, Khayelitsha. Both victims firearms were stolen in each incident. Western Cape Police Commissioner Lt General Khombinkosi Jula has expressed shock following the murders. Jula said the perpetrators of these two crimes "will be hunted down and they will face the might of the law". "On behalf of the SAPS, I express my sincere condolences to the bereaved families," Jula said. “It is disturbing to observe that criminals have no regard for human life. Not even police officers are sparred as they also fall prey to these attacks. Ours is to work around the clock to get to perpetrators." Meanwhile, detectives from the Hawks have taken over the investigations. @capetimes  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
