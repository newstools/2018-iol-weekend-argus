Cape Town - The majority of the Cape Argus's social media audience would welcome social housing being developed in their neighbourhoods, a poll has revealed. On Facebook, 68% answered "yes" to the question: "Would you be comfortable with social housing being developed in your neighbourhood?" while a further 66% agreed on Twitter. There were nearly 200 respondents to the two polls.      The poll was launched in response to the City of Cape Town's plans to convert some of its derelict properties into social housing in the Parow area.   There was some negative sentiment with regards to low-cost housing being built in established areas, however. "Wow. 72% yes so far. There we have it. Come down folks. Mess up the neighbourhood. It will be fun they said. No foresight," wrote Philip Berridge. "This is how the elements entered the neighborhood, crime, and others will start coming in... especially with the low income housing..." posted Cheryl Bruyns. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
