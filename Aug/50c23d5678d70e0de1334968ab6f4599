Johannesburg - The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) eThekwini Region wants the police to probeÂ Economic Freedom Fighters' (EFF) leader Julius Malema, who is seen in a video clip firing a gun in the air at a rally. In the video, which has gone viral, Malema who was dancing with other officials on a stage grabs a rifle that was leaning against the wall and fires it in the air. "It is the considered view of the ANC Youth League that this behaviour was unsafe, irresponsible and was also in contravention of section 120(7) of the Firearms Control Act of 2000," said the youth league on Wednesday in a statement attributed to its eThekwini region spokesperson, Thulisa Ndlela.

"We, therefore, call upon law enforcement agencies to investigate this conduct. Even for a morally compromised fellow like Julius Malema, such conduct is unacceptable and must be condemned. "The ANC Youth League is concerned that such a public display of reckless behaviour will undermine the efforts made in fighting violent crime in our society." However, the EFF has dismissed such concerns saying it was not a real gun Malema used. African News Agency/ANA
