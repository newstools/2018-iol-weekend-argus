Rector of the congregation, Derek van Schalkwyk, said the congregation consists of more than 850 people, about 220 of which are children. “The purpose of the event was twofold; it was a fund-raiser to help the underprivileged in the area, and was also a way to bring the community and the congregation closer together,” said Van Schalkwyk. The day saw the kids split into three “houses”, Yellow House, Red House, and White House, to take part in fun activities such as soccer, sack-racing, and netball, among others. However, everyone’s favourite part of the day was definitely the potjiekos prepared by Van Schalkwyk. Van Schalkwyk said: “With this Children’s Day event, we wanted to show the kids and the community as a whole, that there are a lot of good things we can achieve when we put our heads together and unite.”
