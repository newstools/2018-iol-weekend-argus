DURBAN - BAFANA Bafana’s star goal-minder Itumeleng Khune has thanked the public for the support they have shown to his critically injured girlfriend, fitness bunnie Sbahle Mpisane after her horrific car accident on Thursday. The popular Sbahle was involved in a car accident in the early hours of Thursday morning when her stylish BMW crashed on the Margaret Mncadi Avenue (Victoria Embankment) in Durban at about 4am. According to Isolezwe, the 25-year-old was on her way to her home in Yellowwood Park when the accident happened. Sources told the newspaper she may have been evading a stroller on the road when the accident happened. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said fitness star’s car burst into flames near Wilson’s Whar, but the cause of the accident remained unknown. She said police had opened a case of reckless and negligent driving and circumstances around the accident were still being investigated by police officers at Durban Central SAPS. Meanwhile, a junior electrical power engineer who appeared to have been tasked with repairing the light pole that was struck in the accident found the fitness guru’s broken Gucci watch and crumpled NUR number plates. The man wished Sbahle a speedy recovery and said on Twitter: “It's bad judging from the scene she must be in some typa state (sic)”. He could not be immediately reached.      Taking to Instagram on Friday, Khune, told fans: “Thank you the prayers #GodIsGreat”.
