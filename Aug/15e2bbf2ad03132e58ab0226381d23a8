The rage of residents was ignited by large-scale, provincial SAPS crime prevention activities in the Hangberg area in Hout Bay since early Thursday morning. This sparked unrest in the area and running battles between police and residents occurred, with a least one male resident being taken into custody, after he had run into a nearby home. During the arrest he could be heard asking, "what did I do wrong", while enquiring what had happened to his cellphone. Tires and tree stumps were set alight to block entry into the area, while police were pelted with stones from a high vantage point. It led to Harbour Road been closed at Atlantic Skipper. This resulted in police moving in, with three specialised vehicles deploying several officers in anti-riot gear, who responded by shooting rubber bullets and tear gas. Hangberg residents claimed that one of their dogs ended up being wounded in the skirmish. Two young girls were traumatised after officers detonated a stun grenade at their front door. By the afternoon the area had quietened down, but remained tense. Police are still monitoring the area. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
