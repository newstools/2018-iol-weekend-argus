Johannesburg - The Hawks have promised that the net is closing in on the Guptas to be brought back to the country to face charges related to state capture. Lt-Gen. Godfrey Lebeya, head of the Hawks, told the portfolio committee on police on Wednesday they were finalising the extradition with the United Arab Emirates for the Guptas. But he declined to disclose details on the matter. The police unit has been probing state capture after multiple cases were opened against the family last year. Police Minister Bheki Cele also told the committee that Duduzane Zuma’s case will proceed next year January. This comes after questions were raised about him being shackled by the authorities when he appeared in court last month. Cele said Duduzane was not shackled by the police but by prison officials as the building used by the commercial crimes court in Randburg was not suitable for the courts. Lebeya said they were continuing with the investigations on state capture as more evidence is obtained and he also confirmed that Duduzane will be in court next year January on corruption charges. This related to the charges that he allegedly tried to bribe former deputy minister Mcebisi Jonas. “The question of postponing the case of the suspect to January 2019, there are things that are not ready for public consumption,” said Lebeya. The Guptas apparently left the country in February before the Hawks and other laws enforcement agencies raided their properties. Political Bureau
