Cape Town - While a few millimetres of rain had fallen over the Western Cape over the past two days, it wasn't nearly enough to see Cape Town out of its continued water crisis. The City of Cape Town said a drier than normal start to the month of August meant water savings efforts needed to continue. Dam levels had improved by 1.8 percentage points over the past week, the City said, but this recovery needed the support of the residents of Cape Town. Collective water use was still above the Level 6b restrictions target of 480 million litres per day. "The average water consumption for the past week was 519 million litres per day, which is up from last week’s consumption of 505 million litres per day," the City of Cape Town said. "Dam levels have improved slightly more than last week’s recovery, by 1.8% to 58.8% of storage capacity. "It has been a dry August and rainfall thus far is far below the long-term average for this time of the year in Cape Town. The low rainfall has been slowing down the recovery of Cape Town’s dams. The City of Cape Town is confident that our water users will continue to contribute positively to Cape Town’s water-saving efforts to build a buffer for the summer months ahead," the City said. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
