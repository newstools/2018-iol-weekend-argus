Cape Town - A group of around 300 outraged protesters in Hout Bay have allegedly set fire to several buildings in the area - including the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) building, apparently over their anger with police. By midday on Sunday, protests had turned violent, with police officials at the scene firing rubber bullets to disperse angry protesters who fired flares at police, burned tyres and blocked roads leading into the area.    According to eyewitness reports, two houses, a police boat launching building, as well as the DAFF building and a private residence belonging to an official, were set alight by protesters.
