Thomas Markle has claimed his daughter Duchess Meghan is controlling what Prince Harry wears and eatsÂ and hinted that their marriage might not last. The 74-year-old retired lighting director hasn't spoken to the 37-year-old former actress since before she married the flame-haired hunk at the beginning of May but, from what he's seen online, he's convinced she's controlling his dress sense - even though the royal family have strict fashion rules in place - and his eating habits. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday newspaper, he said: "Meghan is very maternal by nature. She loves to cook and she will mother Harry. He's eating properly now, he's dressing the way she wants him to. All men need that." Thomas also hinted that their marriage may not work out as the brunette beauty took the same approach when she was married to her first husband Trevor Engelson, whom she split from after two years in 2013 due to "irreconcilable differences". Meghan and Harry tied the knot at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, Windsor, on May 19 surrounded by their close relatives, fellow royals and their friends. Thomas was initially invited to the ceremony and to give Meghan away but he was forced to pull out of the big day at the last minute in order to have heart surgery. His decision not to attend the wedding came just days after he caused a stir when he staged paparazzi photos of him buying a suit ahead of the nuptials in Los Angeles. However, despite locking horns with Harry, 33, over the pictures, Thomas was expecting the couple to visit him in the US after their honeymoon - particularly as he had just undergone extensive surgery on his heart - but his wish never came true. Since then, him and his daughter Samantha Markle - the half-sister of Meghan - have been slamming the royal couple in public for distancing themselves from them.
