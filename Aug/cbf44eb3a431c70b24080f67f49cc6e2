Cape Town - The Aquila Private Game Reserve has welcomed a new addition to its buffalo herd. A new calf has joined the family. The teams at the reserve watched as the other animals came to greet the newborn calf. "Following the recent acquisition of Inverdoorn Private Game Reserve in the Western Cape, Aquila Private Game Reserve and Spa was elated to welcome a new calf to the buffalo herd," the reserve said in a statement.  "Aquila teams sat and watched as the adorable new addition to the herd was personally greeted by each female zebra over the course of an hour, like a new born royal! "Even as mum snorted and tried to chase them away, the zebras remained undeterred, going so far as to boop the baby on his nose.  "Aquila plans to introduce more buffalo to the herd over the next few months, to strengthen and broaden the genetic pool," it said. "So, weâ€™re holding thumbs for more youngsters!" @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
