Johannesburg - With Afriforum laying criminal charges against Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema over the rifle incident at his party's birthday bash in East London, the Black First Land First (BLF) now says it will open a case against "the white gunman" seen in viral video clip being handed back the weapon. ''The irresponsible behaviour of the white gunman was calculated to cause harm to black people. The crowd which was potentially under threat was black. The intention of the white man was very clear – that harm should come to black people,'' BLF said in a statement. The party said it will lay charges at Johannesburg's Hillbrow police station on Thursday. Malema has reportedly downplayed the firing of a rifle in the video clip taken at the after party celebrations in Mdantsane's Sisa Dukashe stadium on Saturday. The EFF celebrated its 5th anniversary earlier with thousands of supporters who filled the stadium to the rafters. In the video showing EFF leaders in a song and dance on stage, Malema purportedly fires the rifle into the air before handing it over to a man in the background and then high-fives EFF chairman Dali Mpofu.

The red berets responded on Wednesday that the rifle was a simulation to coincide with their celebrations and that no real bullets were fired, only blanks. BLF said it also wants the gun owner's firearm license revoked. African News Agency/ANA * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535
