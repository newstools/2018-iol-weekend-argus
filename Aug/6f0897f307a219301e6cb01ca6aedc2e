DURBAN - eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede will on Friday address hundreds of female law enforcement authorities at the 2018 Women Imbokodo Armed Forces Parade in Durban. The event forms part of the Women’s Month commemorations and will take place through the Durban CBD with an expected turn-out of more than 500 participants. Female members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), the SA Police Services (SANDF), the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI), the SA Navy and the Durban Metro Police will descend on Dr Pixley KaSeme (West) Street for the start of the parade. The parade is expected to commence at 9am and traffic on Durban's busiest road in the city centre will be closed until about midday, where the mayor will address the law enforcement female officers at the Durban City Hall. Durban Metro Police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad said traffic would only be affected on Dr Pixley ka Seme Street, where the parade will be taking place.   The procession is scheduled to commence at 9am and will proceed east along Dr Pixley Ka Seme Street. A spokesperson for the mayor confirmed she would attend and said the mayor is expected to begin her address at about 10.30am. “Whilst members of the public are most welcome to go and view the parade, motorists are urged to plan their routes well ahead, and do their level best to avoid the route of the procession,” said Sewpersad.
