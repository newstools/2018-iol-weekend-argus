Sonnekus’s white bakkie was earlier found stripped in Mitchells Plain after he and his vehicle went missing from his home in Sun Valley, Fish Hoek. According to the Fish Hoek Community Police Forum, three people were arrested in connection with the stolen vehicle and other items. It said police had also arrested another person for armed robbery. After the discovery of the body police opened a murder docket. Jesse Sonnekus, the 18-year old son of Robert, said the family were struggling to come to terms with his father’s death. “His body was unidentifiable, he was missing for four days. My uncle got called in to identify him. He came over with SAPS to tell us about it. “We’re all pretty distraught. I have an older sister who is 30 and a younger sister who is 16. My dad retired four years ago to take care of us after my mom passed away. I don’t know what to say we’re still trying to deal with it all,” said Jesse. Jesse said he heard of gang involvement in his father’s killing but said his dad had no affiliation to any gangs. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed that a case of murder was being investigated following the discovery of Sonnekus’s body, but no mention was made of gang involvement. Fish Hoek Community Policing Forum chairperson Andre Blom also said he was not aware of gang involvement in the situation. Blom said the incident was not a typical crime to have taken place in Fish Hoek, although crime levels were up. According to the Weekend Argus, theft out of motor vehicles increased in Fish Hoek from 249 in 2016 to 288 last year. @IamAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
