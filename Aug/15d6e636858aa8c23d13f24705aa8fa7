Cape Town - Twitter was ablaze with requests calling on President Cyril Ramaphosa to consider former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela to be appointed as the new director of public prosecutions. This comes after the Constitutional Court judgment that ruled the departure of formerÂ National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Mxolisi Nxasana, after he received a R17 million golden handshake, was illegal. Activist Yusuf Abramjee tweeted: "Advocate @ThuliMadonsela3 is the best candidate for National Director of Public Prosecutions. She has credibility, integrity and has all the required knowledge to ensure justice is served." Twitter user @AdvBarryRoux tweeted "Retweet if you agree that Cyril Ramaphosa should appoint Thuli Madonsela as the new #NDPP." Johan Van Zyl threw his weight behind the movement, requesting that Madonsela be considered for the post.    More South Africans took to Twitter to support the call.                President Cyril Ramaphosa has to appoint a NDPP within 90 days. IOL
