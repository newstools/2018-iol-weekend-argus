Cape Town - Premier Helen Zille has once again called on the SANDF to move its operations, to make way for an estimated 18 000 affordable housing units. The Ysterplaat Air Force Base is a well-located property situated adjacent to the N1 between Ysterplaat/Brooklyn and Century City, and is one of several nationally-owned mega-properties in Cape Town – along with Culemborg, Youngsfield, Wingfield and Denel -  that could potentially yield a combined 93 000 affordable housing units. The majority of the site was donated by the Graaf Trust to the state around World War 1 so that the land could be used for military purposes, and the Trust is a pre-emptive rights holder over the land. Zille said she had held in-principle discussions with the Graaf Trust, who agreed to work with government to develop the land. “I had a meeting with Brett Moore, who represents the Trust, and he says the trustees are perfectly ready to work with government to develop significant sections of the land for precisely the purpose we want,” said Zille. According to Zille, constant changes in the national cabinet – particularly in the Defence and Public Works ministries - had hampered discussions "The global trend of urbanisation should place the land reform spotlight firmly on urban land and housing," Zille said. @capetimes  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
