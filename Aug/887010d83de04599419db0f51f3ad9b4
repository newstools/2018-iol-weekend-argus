The St Joseph’s Marist College pupil powered to South Africa’s T20 record 202 off 62 balls on August 5. On his way to achieving his double ton, he broke three others when he blitzed to 50 off 12 balls; 100 off 28 and 150 off 46. His team is looking to enter the feat in Guinness World Records. He may be shy, but Kieran can undoubtedly express himself with the willow on a cricket field. In that particular game, Kieran’s team scored 352, with the opposition managing only just over 100 in reply. On Wednesday afternoon in the nets, it was clear the right-handed batsman had earned the respect of his peers, with many asking the coaches if they could work with him. How does it feel to break a record at 12? “It felt amazing, especially with my partner on my side. He backed me up and made me feel comfortable,” a bright-eyed Kieran said after a batting session in Kenilworth. His favourite shot is the cover drive and watching him play it, you can tell he’s got it down pat. “When I play it, I play it well,” he said. “My favourite player is JP Duminy but I’m not left handed. I want to be a Proteas cricketer, but if I don’t get there, I have to think of a back-up plan.” Coach Shaheed Adonis said Kieran’s importance in the team was in the powerplays. “He plays an attacking brand of cricket. When he comes off, we win the game without having to struggle. “To manage the expectations, he should to realise that he can’t always go out and achieve that type of record. He still has to play the match situation and play the surface as well and understand how to score runs on a particular surface, which is key.” On Kieran’s record, Adonis said: “We’ve searched every possible record we could find, but the format is quite new and this is the fastest (double ton).” Weekend Argus
