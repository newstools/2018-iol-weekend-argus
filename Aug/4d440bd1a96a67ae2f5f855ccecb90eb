Cape Town - A University of Cape Town staffer is facing disciplinary action over Facebook posts in which he attacked women for using the popular ''men are trash'' reference. The engineering department staff member's posts angered social media users whenÂ he called women ''trash'' along with their parents. Part of the post read: ''I was not there when your mom attracted your trash dad. For some of you trash attraction runs in the family. Learn your history, check is it [sic] not your linage to attract trash. Slaughter a goat sis wam [sister].'' He further stated that people who raped suffered from depression, and that when he was depressed, he wanted to harm his own two-year-old child as he ''saw nothing with her, no love.'' The institution has distanced itself from post and subsequent comments made by the staff member. In a statement issued by the university on Wednesday, UCT said that management had met with the staffer and that due process would be followed to look into the matter and ensure it would be properly investigated and dealt with. ''The content of the post is grave, unacceptable and disturbing, and completely out of alignment with UCT values. It is completely understandable that the post has upset people, leading to reactions of pain and offence. This is most regrettable,'' UCT said in the statement. "The university is dealing with the matter urgently by following the appropriate Employee Relations legislation and the UCT Human Resources policies. UCT confirms that, despite claims to the contrary, the staff member has been informed of the formal process to suspend him." - African News Agency/ Cape Times
