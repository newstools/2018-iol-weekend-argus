Cape Town - Yet another train has gone up in flames in Cape Town, this time at Koeberg railway station, in Maitland. It's the first incident since attacks on the infrastructure of the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) had died down for a few weeks. The City of Cape Town dispatched its fire and rescue services to respond to the incident on Tuesday morning. "Fire and Rescue responded to Koeberg Railway station at 10:05," the City of Cape Town's fire and rescue services spokesperson Theo Layne said. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.
