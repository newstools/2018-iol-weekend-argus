DURBAN - Doves has apologised and deleted social media posts where it wished fitness bunnie Sbahle Mpisane well after being involved in a horrific accident. Mpisane was involved in a horrific accident on Margaret Mncadi Avenue (Victoria Embankment) in the early hours of Thursday morning.  The 25-year-old University of KwaZulu-Natal graduate remains in a critical condition at the St Augustine's Hospital in Durban. Friends, fans and the general public have since wished the fitness bunnie a speedy recovery since news of her accident surfaced on Thursday morning. The 135-year old funeral parlour joined the masses in wishing Mpisane well on Friday, posting on their Twitter and Facebook accounts a message which had the fitness star’s picture along an advert with the words “we’re praying for you” and “insuring a dignified service”. The backlash from social media was heavy and Doves elected to delete the posts. Doves chief executive Minki Rafenyalo, speaking to IOL on Friday, apologised for the posts and said they had been deleted because of the backlash. “We will never wish death upon anyone as a business,” she said. Rafenyalo said Doves had been running a social media campaign titled isiKhumbuzo since the beginning of the year. She said the campaign was about changing perceptions about the funeral parlour industry, celebrating life, promoting healthy living and appreciating people while they were alive.      “We do not profit from death, we are more for life instead of death. We need to celebrate one another while we are alive, show the good memories we have with one another and celebrate the people that contribute positively in their lives,” she said. Rafenyalo said having healthy people who lived longer was in their best interest as an insurance business as they paid monthly premiums, whereas death was the end of business for them. “We are promoting life, we don’t want people to see us as an undertaker,” she said. Asked why then, had Doves deleted the posts and not explained their intentions with the Mpisane picture, Rafenyalo said the “backlash” was too much and said “with the other tweets we did not explain”. “We will be sending an apology, it was not intended to be received in the way that it was, it was done in the spirit of the campaign and we do apologise for that. We will never wish death upon anyone as a business,” she said. This is how social media reacted to Doves picture earlier on Friday.

  August 10, 2018   South Africa can be a strange place. It's weird that Doves Funeral Parlour has a twitter account it's even worse when they post a picture of Sbahle Mpisane who is in hospital & wish her a speedy recovery. — Aluta✊🏿 (@LuthoZA)
