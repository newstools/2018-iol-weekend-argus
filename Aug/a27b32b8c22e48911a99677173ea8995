Cape Town - Two boys, apparently friends, have died after a horrible quad bike accident in Hanover Park earlier this afternoon. One of the boys died on impact at the scene, while the second one died later in hospital. According to police, both boys were aged nine. A resident who arrived at the scene shortly after the accident, Craven Engel, said the boys crashed into a wall of a house in Lynburg Road. Paramedics and the fire brigade were called to the scene, but had to wait for a police escort before they could drive out to the scene. "It was terrible. They both suffered severe head injuries," Engel said. He added that the one boy died instantly, while the other one was rushed to Groote Schuur Hospital. It's not clear who the quad bike belonged to. A family member of one of the boys could not speak immediately as they were still at the hospital. Police said they are investigating a case of culpable homicide. Anyone who might have witnessed the tragic accident is urged to contact the investigation official Detective Sergeant Ricardo Coetzee at 021 690 1517 or 071 914 9663.
