This was revealed on Monday by the municipality’s chief policy analyst, Mahlomola Lengolo, at a crime-prevention stakeholders’ session hosted by the city. In a survey titled “Municipal Services and Living Conditions Survey 3 Year Trends 2015-16, 2016-17 & 2017-18”, the research looked at people’s perceptions of areas they felt were the most unsafe. The municipality’s survey consisted of 1200 interviews from 40 sample areas which included Glenwood, oThongathi and New Germany. The research found that the Durban CBD was consistently in the top three over the past few years. For the 2017/2018 period, the CBD was the third most unsafe place, after uMlazi and KwaMashu. In the 2016/2017 period, the CBD was placed first, followed by KwaMashu and Inanda. “More alarming is the proximity of the areas with the highest crime rate, namely Durban Central, Point, Umbilo and Berea (2015-16 and 2016-17),” Lengolo said. The survey mapped the crime and found there were two “corridors” of high criminal activities. “The southwards high-crime rate corridor starts from Durban Central through to Umbilo, Montclair and uMlazi. A northwards corridor is through Greenwood Park and Durban North,” he said. Rajiv Jaynath, Greenwood Park Community Policing Forum chairperson, said it was hard fighting crime in the area. He said they managed to curb the crime in residential areas, but the industrial areas proved to be a problem as businesses were not co-operating. Jaynath cited the lack of resources as a huge challenge in fighting crime. Metro police commissioner Steve Middleton said his department was dealing with the problem of whoonga addicts who lived near the railway tracks in the city. He said there was a shortage of police officers. Metro police had more than 2500 officers working various shifts in the city. “This, however, is not enough, as one officer can only cover an eighth of a kilometre, which affects their visibility,” said Middleton.
