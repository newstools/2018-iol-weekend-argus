Cape Town - Premier Helen Zille has announced a new Western Cape Police Ombudsman. This follows a thorough selection, consultation and approval process to find a suitable candidate to fill the role previously held by Advocate Vusi Pikoli. “I welcome the approval of appointment in the Provincial Standing Committee on Community Safety in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament today of Major General Johan Brand as the new Provincial Police Ombudsman," Zille said on Wednesday. In recent years, Brand - who has 33 years of service with SAPS - has been a key partner in implementing the Khayelitsha Commission of Inquiry recommendations. “Major General Brand has served as Cluster Commander for Khayelitsha since July 2014. His extensive experience in the South African Police Service has made him a pillar of strength in forging improved relationships between communities and police, in areas such as Khayelitsha and beyond," said Zille. Minister of Community Safety, Dan Plato, commended Brand's knowledge and abilities. "His unique skills set in understanding the laws governing our Republic, their implementation, as well as the policing service delivery constraints in our province, have has set him apart as the preferred candidate to be appointed as the next Western Cape Police Ombudsman,” said Plato. Brand will replace the previous Ombudsman Pikoli, whom Zille said played a "pivotal role in affording the Office of the Ombudsman the credibility it deserves as envisaged under the CSA". "We thank him for his dedicated service to both the Western Cape Government and the people of this province,” said Zille. @capetimes  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
