Durban - A DA councillor has been slammed over a Facebook post in which he offers “tips” for prospective visitors to the city of Durban. Councillor Christopher Pappas, who is a public representative of Ward 31 - which covers parts of Sydenham and Overport, posted the sentiments on his Facebook page earlier this week. In his tips, he said: “There is no public transport. So from the moment you land make sure you have budgeted for a rental car and/or thousands of Rands for taxi/uber. And the airport is far from everything". Pappas also goes on to warn visitors to stay away from the city centre at night, calling it dangerous and said the city offers limited tourist attractions. “The beaches are great but expect to be continuously hounded by homeless people and vagrants on the promenade. Even while you eat or shop,” he said.   Pappas also says two days is long enough in the city as there are better options in KZN. Responding to comments on the Facebook post, Pappas said the city has lost R1 billion in tourism revenue over the last holiday season. "The number of visitors declined by more than 100 000. Tourism has the potential to create thousands of jobs and feed families," he said. eThekwini Municipality acting spokesperson, Mandla Nsele, called Pappas’ comments unsavoury and baseless. “We have referred the matter to the Speaker for advice, in all material time, a councillor is expected to conduct himself or herself at best interest of the municipality,” Nsele said. Meanwhile, local resident Patrick Flynn had his own tips for Durban tourists, which included positivity about the beautiful airport, beaches, affordable e-hailing services such as Uber and "common sense". He said there was no need to venture into the city after hours as there was amazing night life on Florida Road. Pappas comments were polarizing, with some agreeing with him, while others slammed him for his comments.                 In a detailed statement to IOL on Wednesday, Pappas said a R1 billion had been lost to the city due to declining tourism. "Not withstanding that many people have fallen on hard times financial due to a number of political and economic factors, more needs to be done and can be done to boost tourism in the city. Cities like Cape Town and Port Elizabeth are investing in small businesses, safety, cleanliness, community tourism organisations, public transport and broadening their offer to visitors. eThekwini is focused on pumping millions into one to three day events," he said. However, Pappas changed his tune and said the city was blessed with cultural, historical and natural assets, "not to mention that our people are friendly and inviting". "The municpality needs to take a hard look at its approach to attracting tourist both foreign and domestic. It may be harsh to say it, but the reality is that Durban is not currently on people list of places to visit because of crime, cleanliness, no public transport and deteriorating or out dated tourism attractions," he said. To improve tourism in Durban, Pappas said there had to be a public transport line between the King Shaka International Airport and the Beachfront and another, which connected the Beachfront with places such as uMlazi, KwaXimba and eManzimtoti. "We need to drastically increase the amount we give to Community Tourist organisations from R200 000 per year to at least R1 million. With strict plans and development goals attached. Community based tourism management is the global standard.  We need to unlock the potential that exists with our natural heritage such as the old whaling station, Vulamehlo rural areas and outer west natural areas to name a few," he said. Pappas said the city had to focus on a sports tourism strategy to fully unlock tourism, pointing to the success of the Durban July and Comrades Marathon. There are currently no major beach sports competitions in the city: this is another massive opportunity," he said. Daily News
