Johannesburg - An apology letter believed to be from Adam Catzavelos has emerged after a racist video taken while he was at a beach in Greece went viral on social media this week. In his letter, the Joburg man apologises for the "hurt and harm I caused" following the video he recorded where he said the beach he was at was like heaven on earth as there were no black people, who he referred to using the K-word. "I have watched my video and feel total shame. It is hard to put into words what I want to say and genuinely apologise.  I don't expect people to forgive me but will spend the rest of my life repenting and trying to make up for my total lack of respect and judgment," part of the letter reads.  The apology may have come late for Catzavelos, who has been booted out of his family's business. In a statement earlier this week, Catzavelos' family said it was appalled by the video. "It is abhorrent and we fully disassociate ourselves from the sentiments expressed. We reject racism in any form," family representative Nic Catzavelos said. The family business, St George's Fine Food, also lost clients. The Baron Group severed ties with the company after the video surfaced. Butcher Boys has also dropped St George's Fine Food as a supplier. Butcher Boys director, Derryck Myers, said that "we had a conference call and we are disassociating ourselves immediately from St George's. "We do not support what Adam has done"," he said. Another restaurant chain, Braza, as well as The Rib Zone also dropped the company. Catzavelos has also been banned from setting foot in his children's school. His wife, a merchandising director at Nike, was also caught in the furore after people called for Nike to fire her.
