Cape Town - Residents of Kensington took to the streets on Friday morning in protest of a number of shootings that left at least two people dead and two others injured. In one of the cases, the suspect was shot dead and an unlicensed firearm was recovered. The protest on Friday morning caused the closure of Voortrekker Road, the main road in and out of Kensington, Cape Town, between Jakes Gerwel and 5th Avenue, the City of Cape Town said.   Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said rumours that residents were rioting were false and the march was largely peaceful. "These reports of people throwing stones and burning rubbish are not true. The march was peaceful," Van Wyk said. He said concerned residents were meeting with the police at the Kensington police station on Friday afternoon. "It's very peaceful. They are currently meeting with police management at the station, and with the CPF (Community Policing Forum), and airing their grievances." Van Wyk said the march was in response to the shootings this week in which at least two people were shot dead.      "Investigations into cases of murder and attempted murder are ongoing.           "There have been no arrests made as yet." Operation Thunder was continuing in the area, Van Wyk said, and police would maintain a heavy presence. The operations had already yielded two unlicensed firearms, a .45 amd a 9mm pistol, he said. "We note the incidents with concern and we also note the residents' concern over what is happening in their suburb. There will be more police presence." @CapeTimesSA  ctnews@inl.co.za  Cape Times
