CAPE TOWN – Kaizer Chiefs captain Itumeleng Khune missed out on his team’s 3-0 victory over Free State Stars in the MTN8 quarter-finals on Saturday night. This comes after his girlfriend, fitness guru Sbahle Mpisane, was injured in a car accident in the early hours of Thursday morning in Durban. The Daily News website reported on Saturday that Mpisane’s relieved father, Sbu, said that his daughter had been taken off life support at the St Augustine’s Hospital and was now breathing on her own in the intensive care unit. Her father said that Sbahle had sustained multiple fractures to her arms and legs, but that her head had not been injured in the crash on Durban’s Margaret Mncandi Avenue (Victoria Embankment). It is unclear if Khune had flown to Durban to be by Sbahle’s side, but Kaizer Chiefs announced on their website that the goalkeeper had “requested leave to attend to a personal matter”. Khune tweeted well wishes to Sbahle on Women’s Day: “Happy Women’s Day You are in my Prayers #Queeno” and also thanked his followers for their prayers.           Midfielder Willard Katsande took over the Chiefs captaincy against Free State Stars, with Virgil Vries stepping in as the goalkeeper. But coach Giovanni Solinas’ Amakhosi side didn’t have too much difficulty in dispatching Stars at the FNB Stadium, with goals by Dumisani Zuma, Leonardo Castro and Khama Billiat. @ashfakmohamed IOL Sport   Like IOL Sport on Facebook      Follow IOL Sport on Twitter
