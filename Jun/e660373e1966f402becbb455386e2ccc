Miley Cyrus has branded Stefano Gabbana a "d***head" after he claimed her "fine as f**k" friend Selena Gomez was "so ugly" on Instagram recently. The 'Wrecking Ball' hitmaker has jumped to the 25-year-old singer's defence after the outspoken Italian designer - who is the co-founder of the luxury fashion house Dolce & Gabbana - badmouthed her after a fan asked for his opinion on her fashion sense. Taking to Instagram this week, Miley, 25, said in the comments section of a photograph of them posing together shared by a fan page: "Well what that d**k head said (if it's true) is f***ing false and total bulls**t. She's fine as f**k." Gabbana found himself in hot water recently when he responded to an Instagram post by The Catwalk Italia showing Selena in a montage of red dresses. 
Gabanna commented in Italian: "è proprio brutta", which roughly translated means "she's so ugly." A legion of Selena fans hit back at the designer, including actress Jaime King who claimed the fashion guru clearly couldn't handle the "beauty" of Selena's "soul and physical being" and encouraged her followers to boycott the brand. She wrote on Twitter: "Because they are ugly humans who cannot handle the beauty of S that radiates from her Soul and her physical being. #boycottdolceandgabbana" Selena herself has kept quiet on the matter. Gabbana and his partner Domenico Dolce have become known for their outspoken comments on social media as in 2015 they entered into a war of words with Sir Elton John for their homophobic comments about IVF parenthood. Kate Moss and Victoria have also been targeted by the fashion duo in the past. Meanwhile, this is not the first time Miley has stood up against the brand as after congratulating her younger brother Braison for making his catwalk debut at the D&G show at Italian Fashion Week in Milan last year, she went on to criticise the designers for their political opinions. She wrote: "PS D&G, I STRONGLY disagree with your politics.... but I do support your company's effort to celebrate young artists & give them the platform to shine their light for all to see!"
