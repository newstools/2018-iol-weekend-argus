The school received e-Braille portable computers, a device for scanning and reading printed text and a portable MP3 player designed for blind users from MTN, officially handed over by the MEC for Social Development, Albert Fritz. “These computers are going to aid our learners, and will equip them in technological skills,” said Fritz. “We must not limit their education because of their visual impairment, it is their right to learn computers as well,” he said. Fritz encouraged learners to focus on their education so they can improve their living conditions. The school’s principal, Fletcher Fisher, said learners will now master basic computer skills as most of them, have never used a computer before. “We are grateful to MTN and the Department of Social Development for the computer lab and the computers,” said Fisher. “Our learners will not struggle when they go to tertiary institutions, because they too will be technologically advanced. “Most of the learners come from impoverished backgrounds and they need resources to keep up with the education system,” he said. An 18-year-old, Keagan Currie in Grade 10, said: “I am feeling good about our school receiving these computers because my performance in technology and other subjects is going to improve.”
