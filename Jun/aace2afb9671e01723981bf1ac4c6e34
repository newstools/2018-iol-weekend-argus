That’s according to the City of Cape Town’s traffic and speed camera report which has recommended that officers and cameras be visible and that the fine system not be used as a cash-cow. The report is before council at the end of next month. JP Smith, mayoral committee member for safety, security and social services, said the committee has gone with the more visible route. “We will now be doing operations where it is visible to people. The recording of motorists in traffic vehicles or hidden away is stopped. On the issue of fines, we need to look at the justice system, because the fines we issue don’t help the situation. “We are getting more people to ensure that fines are paid, but there are repeat-offenders,” he said. According to the new regulations, a warning sign should be placed not more than 1km from the stationed area, in the direction being enforced. Speed cameras, including mobile camera units, must be visible to approaching or departing motorists from where the enforcement is done. Where a fixed camera has been installed, it must be painted yellow in full, with reflective sheeting. The City received 16 comments on the new policy. There were 12 comments that were noted and referred to concerns other than in respect of the new policy. Resident Ernest Roodt said he disputed the notion that speed cameras are there for road safety. “If the City was honest and truthful in really caring about road safety, then you would implement measures to force people not to speed, like traffic calming and other measures,” he said. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
