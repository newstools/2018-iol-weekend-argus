The clan from Vredehoek recently decided it was time to do a re-shoot of that picture. John’s daughter, Nina Vass, rounded up the family and planned the photo. “I came across the old newspaper clipping recently, and noticed it was taken 30 years ago, so thought it would be fun to do one of those then-and-now photos,” Vass said. “We’re a close family, where our dad has been such a support to us in our individual endeavours and I love how this old picture makes him look like the hero he is,” she added. The original photo was published in the Cape Argus after a family friend, who worked for the newspaper at the time, suggested to the family that it would be a good idea. Now all grown up and living their own lives, the Van der Spuy children still hold their father in high regard. “Although we’re all a lot bigger (or did the bed get smaller?), we still look up to him as we did in that photo,” said Vass. She said a typical Father’s Day had always started with the children trying to get up before their father to surprise him with gifts and affection. “We’d always tried to get up earlier than him, so that we could make him tea in bed and take him breakfast. “Then we’d pile on the bed and give him anything from a toiletry bag to some shaving cream and always a handmade card.” Vass works with her father as a property valuer and director at Steer & Co. Her sister Lucy owns her own digital marketing agency and their brother Phillip is a helicopter pilot. The two sisters have become parents themselves, while Phillip is expecting his first child in November. John has been married to Heather for 41 years. “With all the additional fathers in our lives, Father’s Day is a little more difficult logistically. “My brother is away this weekend, so we haven’t organised much, but I’m pretty sure we’ll meet for an early breakfast. “There may even be a bottle of whisky in it for the old man this year,” said Vass.
