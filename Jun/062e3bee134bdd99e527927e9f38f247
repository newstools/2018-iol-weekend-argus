CAPE TOWN - Google announced a General Availability feature which will come into effect in July and will ensure that all Gmail users utilitise the new redesigned Gmail, even if they do not want to. This comes after Google in April released a redesign for Gmail. The redesign saw a new look as well as new features being added to Gmail such as snoozing emails, Smart Reply and turning your Gmail into offline mode.           Now, Google has announced an Early Adopter Program (EAP) which will allow Gmail users to access new capabilities like Gmail offline and nudging as a means to test out the new features before it rolls out in full swing.
