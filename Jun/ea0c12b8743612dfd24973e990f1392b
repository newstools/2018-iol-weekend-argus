The public meeting was organised to get input and suggestions for the new name.      The meeting was chaotic from the onset, with several attendees ignoring calls for silence.

Hundreds of people eager to have their say about the future name of the airport left disappointed after the meeting was called to an end prematurely. Just three speakers had an opportunity to present their arguments before clashes between differing supporters broke out. EFF leader Julius Malema called for the airport to be renamed after Winnie Madikizela-Mandela after the mother of the nation died. At her funeral, Malema called on the ANC to honour her by renaming the airport after her. An online poll revealed the majority of those who voted (75%) want the airport in Cape Town renamed after Madikizela-Mandela.      @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
