Bonang Matheba graced SABC 3's 'Real Talk' stage on Monday night, as the first guest on the popular show with its new host, Azania Mosaka. Mosaka, who filled in on the show before, officially took over the reins from Anele Mdoda who announced her resignation in May. Matheba was a guest on the show for the very first time since its inception two years ago, and with Mzansi's eyes watching, Mosaka delved into Matheba’s life. One of the questions Mosaka put to Matheba is whether she thinks of DJ Zinhle, and Twitter was impressed with the way the TV personality said "a lot", with out really revealing anything at all.

While Bonang was visibly uncomfortable, she managed to keep her composure by sticking to the same reply, even when asked if she had any regrets. Peeps took to Twitter streets to weigh in on the interview. Many praised Matheba for the way she handled herself and some thought Mosaka never asked the right questions..                     After the interview, Matheba hugged her bestie Lorna Maseko and her cousin Tebogo ‘Pinky Girl’ Mekgwe, who were seated in the crowd, before making quick exit, but was asked to return to set to snap some pics with Mosaka.      Other confirmed guests on Real Talk on 3 this week includes kwaito artist Mshoza, Lady Zamar and DJ Zinhle, who will make an appearance on the variety show on Tuesday.
