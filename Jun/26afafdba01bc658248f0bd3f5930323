Durban - Gold Circle has distanced themselves from comments posted on social media by South African model, Shashi Naidoo. Their comment comes in the wake of Naidoo's remarks on her social media in which she apparently referred to Gaza as a “****hole”. In a statement last night, Gold Circle said; "Gold Circle has recently been made aware of a series of social media messages posted by Shashi Naidoo, who was appointed by an outside service provider to appear at this year’s Vodacom Durban July  on Saturday, July 7.  It is understood that her scheduled appearance at the event has now been cancelled." They added that they would like to clarify that the views and opinions expressed by Shashi do not reflect those of Gold Circle, the Vodacom Durban July or those of its associated sponsors.
