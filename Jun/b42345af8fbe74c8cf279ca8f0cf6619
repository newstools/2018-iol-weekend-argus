Johannesburg - An online poll posted by Absa on Black Tax on Tuesday took a sour turn after angry users blasted the bank as "insensitive" and "racist". On Tuesday, the bank posted a poll on Twitter asking users to define what they considered black tax to be, with options ranging from: a source of anxiety, a source of pride, a financial burden as well as a responsibility. Black tax refers to the financial obligation of black people who move into higher-paying jobs to provide for extended family. Of course, Absa's tweet did not go well with users, with the bank being branded racist and insensitive for putting up the poll. Many users appeared to be offended by the use of the term to describe taking care of extended family, with some even saying it had a racial undertone.      #BlackTax is.  â€” Absa (@Absa) June 12, 2018  See some reactions to the poll:     I don't see how someone taking care of their family should be labeled anything!!!
