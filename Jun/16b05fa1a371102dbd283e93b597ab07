His agent, Tim Sukazi of Quality Talent, says Komphela is a wanted man.

At this stage, I can't reveal the names of the clubs who have enquiried about him. I have inquiries locally and there's one team overseas" Sukazi elaborated without mentioning names. Other than Chiefs, SuperSport United and Polokwane City are currently the only teams in top flight football that don't have coaches. Matsatsantsa a Pitori parted ways with Eric Tinker in the middle of the season, while Bernard Molekwa has been an interim coach at City since the departure of Luc Eymael. Baroka FC had a vacancy, but are reported to have hired former Kaizer Chiefs striker and Zambian international Wedson Nyirenda. Nyirenda vacated his post as the Zambia head coach in May. Komphela has been around the coaching circle for a while having managed clubs like Dynamos, Manning Rangers, South Africa's Under-23 national team, Free State Stars, Platinum Stars and Maritzburg United. The former Bafana Bafana captain is still searching for the first silverware of his coaching career. Komphela has also served at the senior national team as an assistant coach to Stuart Baxter and Pitso "Jingles" Mosimane.      SuperSport United did also enquire about Eymael but they have yet to open official talks with Free State Stars boss. The Belgian is still contracted at Stars and has a buyout clause on his current deal with the club. It wouldn't come as a surprise if United are interested in the services of Komphela.
