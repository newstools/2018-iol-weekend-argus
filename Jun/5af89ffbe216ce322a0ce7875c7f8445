This is what Cape Town musician Chad Saaiman thinks about being a father. He said his daughter, Summer, 8, was an important part of his life. Photographs of the two, with loving captions attached, are posted regularly by Saaiman on social media. “It’s (being a father) about making sure that your child has a better life-experience than you did,” he said. For Father’s Day, Saaiman, together with his siblings, will take their father Abie out for brunch. “My father has taught me a lot about life. Respect, punctuality are some of the values he has taught me.” Saaiman is passing on the same values to his daughter. “I always try to make sure I am on time for her. “When we have to go somewhere, I make sure I am not late,” he said. He also has conversations with Summer about working hard for everything she wants in life. Summer’s name was inspired by the movie 500 Days of Summer. “The name means light, positivity and all beautiful things,” he said. Saaiman, who survived an attempted hijacking in Johannesburg seven years ago, said the experience gave him a different view of life. “Sometimes it feels like it happened many years ago, then other times it feels recent. But I now have a different approach to life. “I am grateful for every day I get out of bed. I live in the moment.” Saaiman’s fans will be delighted to learn of his new video for the track titled Play, which was released this week. The video, which features Saaiman and hip hop artist YoungstaCPT, tells of the ups and downs of falling in love, and courtship.  noloyiso.mtembu@inl.co.za  Weekend Argus
