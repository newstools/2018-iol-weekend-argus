JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates are both battling for the services of talented left winger, Vincent Pule, who will leave Bidvest Wits at the end of the month. Pule's agent, Tim Sukazi of Quality Talent Sports, confirmed that Chiefs and Pirates have shown interest in landing his client. "He is definitely leaving Wits. We told them last year in October that the boy is leaving when his contract expires at the end of the season. We told Wits before the Telkom Knockout final. Chiefs and Pirates are interested in him," Sukazi said without any doubts. Amakhosi didn't replace George Lebese with an out and out left winger when he departured and joined Mamelodi Sundowns. Edmore Chirambadare who can operate as a left winger is set to be loaned out for the new season. This will leave Chiefs with the ageing Siphiwe Tshabalala as the only option on the left. On other hand, Pirates have Luvuyo Memela - who has established himself as an attacking left winger. Memela needs competition and Pule can certainly bring that element in to Bucs set-up. "I'm away in Limpopo this week. We will sit down with him and he will take the decision. As I speak to you, he hasn't signed any contract with anyone." Sukazi elaborated.  Pirates will be competing in five competitions next season. They will be campaigning in the MTN 8, Telkom Knockout, Nedbank Cup, Absa Premiership and the Caf Champions League. Sukazi also confirmed that out of favour, Mamelodi Sundowns defender Thabo Nthethe has joined Chippa United. Nthethe struggled for game time in the season that has just ended.
