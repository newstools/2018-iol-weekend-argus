DURBAN - Allegations of pupils being sexually abused by male teachers at Durban’s renowned Adams College have surfaced, with some current and former pupils taking to social media to break their silence this week. Those affected spoke out about the alleged sexual incidents on Twitter and Facebook, calling for the department of education to take action against the implicated teachers. Some of the historic school's alumni included the Presidents of Botswana and Uganda - Milton Obote and Sir Seretse Khama, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, ANC founder Dr John Dube and many other leaders in the ANC, including present day ministers.  The pupils of the 165-year-old school have been using the hashtags #AdamsCollegeTrashyTeachers, #SaveAdamsCollegeFromPaedophiles and #SaveOurGirls to spread the message and raise awareness on social media.            One pupil said: "We are putting an end to teachers who take advantage of learners, sleeping with them casually, impregnating them and forcing them to terminate the pregnancies. Emotionally abusing them, harassing them and expecting them to be okay with that.” Department of Education spokesperson Sicelo Khuzwayo said the allegations would be investigated. “Some of the allegations are quite alarming and therefore need to be thoroughly investigated. We will not accept if any teacher is involved in such conduct. Teacher and pupil sexual relations are prohibited. Teachers are expected to play a parental role at schools,” said Khuzwayo. nabeelah.shaikh@inl.co.za SUNDAY TRIBUNE
