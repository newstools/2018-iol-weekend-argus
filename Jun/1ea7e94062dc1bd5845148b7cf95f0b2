It is alleged that one person was found dead in the car. Another was found outside the car with gunshot wounds. A third man was found with gunshot wounds to his leg. Police are pursuing a fourth man. Ngobile Gwala, the KZN police spokesperson, said a 40-year-old man parked on the side of the road to buy vegetables on Mhlangane road, Avoca, when he was accosted by four armed suspects travelling in a silver Toyota Yaris.
