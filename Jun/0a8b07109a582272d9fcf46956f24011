The Mitchells Plain boy was in the car with Edas’s husband and police officer, Captain Jacques Edas, when assailants opened fired. His grandson Jaymar Peterson, 3, and a businesswoman, Lin Min, were also in the vehicle. They survived and were unharmed. Jacques Edas had offered Min, who is based at the  KTC Family Store in Nyanga, a lift to Ottery, according to reports. He had been off duty. As they were about to leave her store, gunmen approached his car and opened fire and struck Edas in the chest, abdomen and arm. Jethro was hit in the head. Edas managed to drive to the Nyanga police station. He is in hospital. Jethro died on the scene. Amelia Edas said her family were still in shock. Jethro, who lived around the corner from the Edas’, had spent most of his time with her and her husband. Amelia said she packed lunch for Jethro, a pupil at Yellowood Primary, for school. He would return later and only leave after supper, and even bathed at the Edas residence, she added. “The emptiness is already felt in this house. He went everywhere with us. When he wasn’t here we missed him,” Amelia said. “He said that one day he was going to build a big house and only me, my husband and his ma (grandmother) would live in it. “He also wanted to become a policeman just like my husband. Uncle Jacques was his superhero. He had so many dreams. These criminals robbed this little boy of all his dreams.” Jethro’s grandmother Naomi Fritz said: “Amelia and Jacques were like his second parents. I’m so thankful to them. I’m going to miss him very much.” Executive director of the Trauma Centre for Survivors of Violence, Valdi van Reenen-Le Roux, said 80 children were murdered in the Western Cape in 2017, with 27 killed so far this year.
