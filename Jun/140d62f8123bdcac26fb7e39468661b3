 Happy birthday to the OG Queen!!! You are many characters in one body and many people do not know that. It’s always entertaining to watch 🤣 The older you are in years the younger you are in personality and looks. Quite unfair actually!! No words can explain the love and gratitude I have for you being my mom and Ro’s Granma. I love you to the moon and back. Hope you enjoy today with dad. We’ll celebrate when you get back. Love you mucho Ma. Long live The Queen. 👸🏽❤️💃🏽😘 A post shared by  Sedii Matsunyane (@sediimatsunyane) on Jun 10, 2018 at 1:00am PDT To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
