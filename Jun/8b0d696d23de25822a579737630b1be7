Durban - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has justified its decision to approach the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to take action against EFF leader Julius Malema who at the weekend accused Indian communities of discriminating against their African counterparts. SAHRC had on Wednesday confirmed that it was considering DA’s complaint against Malema. Malema raised eyebrows at the EFF’s Youth Day commemoration rally in Matlosana in North West on Saturday when he took a swipe at the Indian community. “(The) majority of Indians hate Africans, (the) majority of Indians are racist, and we must never be scared to say that they are racists. I’m not saying all Indians, I’m saying the majority of them." “Africans and Indians do not marry each other because the majority of those Indians see us as subhuman,” he said. DA MP Haniff Hoosen said his party had approached the SAHRC because Malema was using his leadership to break racial bridges instead of building them. “Apartheid divided people on the basis of race, and to continue with the comment that he had made we will only serve to perpetuate those divisions. “Our appeal to Mr Malema is to refrain from using language and comments that seek to sow division among racial communities,” said Hoosen. However, EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the fighters were fearing no reprisal against Malema since his comment was address racial challenges in the country, especially in KwaZulu-Natal. “Those who are unable to engage and respond often turn to the institution to intimidate and silence him (Malema),” said Ndlozi.
