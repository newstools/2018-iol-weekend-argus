Yesterday, the Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA) and the Samas announced the disqualification of Tigi by Sands, which was nominated in the Record of the Year category, and Lake by the Ocean by Mobi Dixon, which was up for Best Remix. Tigi was removed after RiSA became aware that Sands was a Swazi, not a South African national. Mobi Dixon’s Lake by the Ocean is a remix of American R&B artist Maxwell’s song, a contravention of the Sama rules. The Record of the Year is a non-submission category with RiSA using the statistics it receives from Radiomonitor to determine which were the most played songs for 2017. Radiomonitor is the industry standard airplay-monitoring service used by all major record labels in the country. Sands’s manager, Lindsey Arends, said he has been in frequent contact with the music body. “It was an oversight on the side of the Samas. When the nominations were announced I was in communication with RiSA, asking them (if they were) sure about this because Sands is not South African. We have no actual disappointment  from our side,” said Arends. RiSA chief executive Nhlanhla Sibisi said Sands would have qualified for the category had there been a South African on the record and clarified the regulations around remixes. “If it was a collaboration then it would have been fine because there would be equal billing. With regard to the issue of Lake by the Ocean, in previous years DJ Sbu won an award for his remix of Josh Groban’s Remember When It Rained but we’ve changed that now so you can only remix South African songs.” RiSA and Sama will investigate how the breaches happened. Tigi has been replaced by Love Me in the Dark by Sketchy Bongo featuring Kaien Cruz.  Mwanagu by Jackie Queens and VeneiGrette, remixed by Enoo Napa, replaces Lake by the Ocean .
