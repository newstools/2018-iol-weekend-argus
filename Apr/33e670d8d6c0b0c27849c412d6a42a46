Lamb, who until recently was in song group Blackbyrd, plays the role of Belgravia resident Merle Abrahams’s daughter, Abigail. Abigail and her white boyfriend Alan White announce their engagement to their parents and the story unfolds from there. Lamb dazzles on the stage executing every dance move perfectly and hitting each note. She was head-hunted for the role by Marc Lottering, who wrote the play and takes the role of Aunty Merle. “I was called by Marc Lottering the year before last and he told me he was doing this project, Aunty Merle The Musical. He knew I hadn’t been in theatre for a long time and I was in a space in my music career where, after eight years, I was only doing music.” Lamb, who studied musical theatre at the Waterfront Theatre School, wanted to return to theatre. She agreed to Lottering’s offer after speaking to her mother about it, which she said Lottering still jokes about. “It was a big yes. It was always a dream of mine to be in a musical with him.” She co-wrote the music for the play with Lottering. “It was a cool time. Last year this time, we wrote our first song for the musical, which is called I Believe In Love. We work so well together.” Lamb’s advice to the youth is to pray for direction and to be true to themselves. Aunty Merle The Musical will run at the Baxter Theatre until April 28.
