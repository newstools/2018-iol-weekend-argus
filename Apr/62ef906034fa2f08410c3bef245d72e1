The third installment of the annual event opened at Cape Town International Convention Centre  with  performances that thrilled fans. The event has grown 
in size over the past three years having originally been at The Lookout at the Waterfront, which was a smaller venue. Loyiso Mkize, creator of the popular local superhero, Kwezi, took part in panel discussions on diversity in the comic book industry and the rise of Black Panther. “Why not diversity? We’ve seen such a one take as far as representation for so many decades with the typical white protagonist that forms our frame of reference,” said Mkize. “It’s important that kids see themselves in superheroes and for me Kwezi makes sense in South Africa where the children are predominately black.” “Someone will read Kwezi in 20 years’ time and they’ll talk about how that shaped them and they’re thinking, it sounds very dramatic but it’s important,” he said. Having been at previous stagings of FanCon, Mkize said that it provided a great platform to tell South African stories and this year he showcased his drawing process live at the event. Brothers Sachin and Sarin Somers came dressed as Batman and Venom respectively. They have been collecting comic books for over 20 years and said that it was this obsession that brought them out to the event. “I’ve been a fan all my life. I’m from the generation where Christopher Reeve is still my Superman,” said Sachin. In April 1938, Action Comic #1 introduced the world to Superman and in honour of this 80th anniversary milestone, a mini exhibit of the original Action Comics issues was on display.
