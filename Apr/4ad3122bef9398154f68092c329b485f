Police and Search and Rescue divers recovered the body of a local actor on Friday, after a 40-metre plunge to his death in the Drakensberg. Details are still sketchy, but it is believed the 39-year-old man, who cannot be named until his family has been notified, was on-set when he lost his footing and fell into a river and washed over Sterkspruit Waterfall near Monks Cowl on Thursday evening. According to reports, the crew was filming a fight scene when the actor fell at around 5.30pm. Chief Okhahlamba Fire Emergency Service Fred Halgreen, Okhahlamba Municipal firemen and volunteers spent five hours searching for the man without any results. “We called off the search at around 11pm," Halgreen told a local newspaper. The search was resumed on Friday morning, and the actor's body was reportedly recovered from the pool at the bottom of the waterfall. Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane told Times Live that an inquest docket had been registered. * This is a developing story
