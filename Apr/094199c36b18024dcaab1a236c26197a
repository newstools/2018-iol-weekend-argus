Tristan Thompson has reportedly been spotted locking lips with a mystery woman in New York last weekend.   The video clip shows Tristan - who is seen wearing a hooded jacket - chatting to the woman before he seemingly leans in for a kiss, according to the woman who captured the footage.    She said: "I was there and he was on the table right next to us with a group of friends and some girl who he was obviously making out with all night. "They were holding each other and it was so obvious. They were there when I got there and they were part of a big group of friends. "They were talking and being around each other all night. He was texting and talking on the phone and she was obviously looking over his shoulder. "Everybody knew who he was. We talked about it and everybody watched them make out several times. I have obviously seen him before and people around me were like, 'That's Tristan Thompson'. I have seen him on TV." The unnamed source admitted to being shocked by what she witnessed. She confessed: "I love the Kardashians and I think it's devastating. I really did believe he was a good guy. "I feel so bad for Khloe now because she is pregnant and I want her to know but at the same time I don't. I don't think their fans will like what they see."Â 
Meanwhile, TMZ has accused Tristan of cheating on Khloe with two other women back in October.   Bang Showbiz
