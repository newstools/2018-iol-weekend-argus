CAPE TOWN - WhatsApp has evolved since its inception in 2009, and the messaging app keeps updating its features. It's safe to say that some of you may not be aware of several WhatsApp features that can, in fact, make your life easier. There are some basic features we should all know: Like if you happen to forget to reply to a WhatsApp message, you can simply mark the chat as "unread" and it serves as a reminder to respond to the message. Another great tip that most people know are how to mute those annoying group chats. But here are some of the WhatsApp features which you may well not be aware of. See who read your message in a group chat To see who read your message in a WhatsApp group, simply long press your sent message and select the Information Key on an Android device to see a list of recipients who have quietly read your message. For iOS devices, simply swipe left or right on your sent message and the list will pop up. Hide last seen At times, you may feel like you do not want your WhatsApp presence to be tracked because you may feel obligated to reply to that one message you were avoiding. With WhatsApp’s hide last seen feature, no one will know when you were last on WhatsApp. How to turn hide last seen on: Select Settings then Privacy. You will see at the top of the list will be a Last Seen option. Tap on Last Seen and select Nobody. Now, no one will be able to track your last move. Mute conversations At times, you may find yourself receiving constant WhatsApp texts which comes with constant notification alerts. If you at times want to be left uninterrupted or if the constant notification alerts are all too troublesome, simply mute selected conversations. You can mute conversations by selecting a contact on WhatsApp then tapping the person’s name which will list the Contact Info. Here, you will see a drop-down list appear which include Media and Links, Starred Messages, Chat Search and Mute. Select the fourth option, Mute and you can choose to mute a conversation for either 8 hours, 1 week or a year. You can also choose to unmute a conversation at any time. Limit data use WhatsApp can accumulate lots of space on your device. In order to clear up some space on your device, you can limit data usage. Go to Settings, scroll to data usage option and you can limit the files that WhatsApp will automatically download.
