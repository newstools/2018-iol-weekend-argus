The crowd went wild as Supa Mega performed some of his hit tracks.           After 12 years of bringing the youth together, BTTC announced that the movement will be coming to an end in 2021. This unique youth event has grown into the largest public display of both commercial and underground hip hop in Africa, presenting a day of live music, street art, break-dancing, art installation, skateboarding, film, street fashion, gaming, speakers and panel discussions. From the daytime events to the night performances, this is one time that the inner city comes alive with true freedom of expression providing a destination for hip hop fans, artists and industry related individuals to converge and celebrate the experience of hip hop and youth culture.                     Back To The City takes place every on April 27 at Mary Fitzgerald Square, downtown Jozi. IOL
