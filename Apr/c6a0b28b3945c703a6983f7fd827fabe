Forecaster Lebogang Makgabi said the rain had made little to no impact on dam levels. There is very little rain predicted for next week, with only a 30% chance on Thursday and Friday. Less than 5mm is expected per day. At this point, Makgabi was unable to tell what this winter’s rainfall would be like. UCT climate scientist Peter Johnston explained how this week’s rain came about. “The recent rain we had was a result of a front combined with low-pressure system off the West Coast and it was most unexpected.” Johnston, who was visiting Theewaterskloof Dam when Weekend Argus contacted him, said the three days of rain had made little difference to the level of the dam. “I can’t see any water running into the dam as such.” James-Brent Styan, spokesperson for Environmental Affairs MEC Anton Bredell, said he was unable to confirm the impact of the rain. “The earliest indication we will have will be Monday per the Department of Water and Sanitation update.” However, he said every bit helped. “For dams to recover fully, we need above-average rainfall for an extended period in our catchment areas,” he said. As of Monday dam levels in the Western Cape averaged 18.2%, compared to 25.6% at the same time last year.
