Many residents have admired what Cecil McDoy, 59,  calls the New Garden of Eden, which he created from bits and pieces and scrap that people who he does odd jobs for have given him. The area, situated below Wetton Road bridge and adjacent to the railway line, resembles an enchanted garden.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

He has used succulents given to him - which use very little water - and has placed old toys in strategic places. It even boasts a tiny, waterless splash pool, and a table with chairs and a patch of green turf. He has used rocks and tiles to adorn the garden, as well as to create paths. McDoy said he has been living under the bridge for eight years and decided to use his love of landscaping to beautify the area. The garden has been there since 2014. McDoy said he loves what he does and has been happy to be able to make a positive contribution to the neighbourhood. “A lot of people stop their cars to look or walk past. Some people even sit at the table and chairs,” he said. McDoy said he does his best to ensure the area remains safe, especially for those who use trains and need to walk under the bridge from the 
station. “When I am busy in the garden I always think it is such a pity that don’t have much.” Ward councillor Mark Kleinschmidt said McDoy has a talent for turning 
rubbish into something 
beautiful. However, he cannot condone the garden as McDoy did not get permission to create it. “But this kind of conduct by street people should be encouraged and regulated,” he added. Kleinschmidt said other homeless people in the vicinity have followed suit. “It has become contagious. This restores their pride and dignity.”
