Passers-by and workers from nearby factories said motorists taking chances as the boom gate closes was a daily occurrence at the crossing. “It is worse in the mornings, everyone seems to be in a hurry; not only are they risking their own lives but those of the people in the car with them. I cannot even imagine how the train drivers feel seeing what is happening in front of them and being unable to prevent it,” said Moses Fisher. Initial indications were that the driver of the bakkie involved in the collision had attempted to cross as the train was approaching the Buttskop crossing. The parliamentary portfolio committee on transport called on the Railway Safety Regulator to speedily determine how accidents involving trains and vehicles could be put to a stop. Chairperson Dikeledi Magadzi said the body was saddened by the Blackheath crash and sent its condolences to the families of the dead. “This accident speaks to the need to urgently address the maintenance of rail systems, especially in the Western Cape, but also generally throughout the country,” she said. The United National Transport Union also urged motorists to exercise caution when crossing railway lines. “It is horrific that innocent lives are lost because the driver did not take caution at the level crossing,” said the union’s general secretary Steve Harris. In 2010, 10 children died at the same crossing when a train collided with the taxi they were travelling in. - Additional reporting ANA
