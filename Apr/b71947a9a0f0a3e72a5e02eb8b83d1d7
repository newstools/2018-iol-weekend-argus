I donâ€™t think you really understand how hard it is to take a good family pic. This was all we got before all three kids started crying. I think I cried too A post shared by  Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Apr 4, 2018 at 4:08pm PDT  Kim recently admitted she was "shocked" that her oldest daughter North has been so "nice" to her baby sister because she struggled to adjust when Saint was born. She said: "They love her. I'm so shocked that North is so nice and she's still... it's her world and she's the sweetest, but it's more like she and Saint have a thing. She's very warm with her sister." And Kim thought Saint would've been riddled with jealousy when little Chicago entered the household, but he smothers her in "kisses and hugs" every day. She explained: "I was more worried about him, that he would be more jealous, [like] how North was with Saint. But he's so good with her. Every day he has to give kisses and hugs. Literally, as I was walking in, [I was looking] on my phone at the video Kanye sent me with the kids trying to climb into her crib."
