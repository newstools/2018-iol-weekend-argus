Cape Town - Runners took to the hills around Paarl yesterday for the Paarlberg Half Marathon. Misheck Sithole took home first place with Lindikhaya Ntangayi in second and Siyabonga Sakweat in third. Traditionally this event has been a Half Marathon, however, this year an added attraction is a 6.5km Fun Run. This event attracted several top athletes from the Western Cape and South Africa and was changed from an 18.4km circular route to a 21.1km, in line with International Standards. Due to floods 3 years ago, the organizers had to change the original circular route. This, together with the lack of sponsors led to a drastic decline of entries. The Paarl Athletic Club, founded in 1895 under the auspices of the Boland Athletics has been hosting the Paarlberg Half Marathon since 1935. The event is the most beautiful race in the Boland and it is also the second oldest race in South Africa. It is a race that has stood the test of time and without a doubt, an event that has to be preserved for years to come. The first winner in 1935 was Laurie Du Preez in a time of 71:34. The legendary Willie Olivier won this event six times and was the first athlete to complete this event in under an hour, viz 58:55. This record was held for 24 years and broken by Jan Tau in 1990 in a time of 56:50. Weekend Argus
