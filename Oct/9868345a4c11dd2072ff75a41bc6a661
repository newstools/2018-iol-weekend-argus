Cape Town - The murder of top criminal advocate Pete Mihalik appears to have been a targeted assassination. Mihalik was gunned down while sitting in his car outside a private school on the Atlantic Seaboard, Cape Town. He was dropping his eight-year-old son at Reddam House primary school when he was shot dead. His son was also injured in the incident. Mihalik had represented several high profile suspected and convicted criminals with links to the criminal underworld. Cape Bar Society of Advocates chairperson advocate Ismail Jamie SC, said they were all shocked by the incident. “It’s terrible news. Our thoughts are with his children. We don’t have any other information than what there is already in the public. “It does appear as a targeted assassination and we know that he was a criminal defence lawyer. We as the Cape Bar see his murder as an assault on the criminal justice system,” said Jamie. Pete’s colleague, advocate William Booth, said he was completely devastated by the news. “I have known Pete since his days as a prosecutor at the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court, we have also worked on matters together. “This is devastating. We are in complete utter shock,” he said. Booth said he last saw Pete at the Western Cape High Court last Thursday where he was busy with a trial.

Lawyers should be regarded as objective people dealing with matters. Everyone deserves the right to legal representation," said Booth. @Zoey_Dano @MarvinCharles17  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za   marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
