Parliament - Government was considering capping the price of 93 unleaded petrol, Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said on Thursday. Radebe, who joined his communications counterpart, Nomvula Mokonyane, during the post-cabinet media briefing, said they were consulting the industry on the proposal. "Last week, as the department, we started a consultation process with the petroleum industry with specific reference of asking their expert advice of what the impact would be if we were to set a maximum price for 93 unleaded [petrol]," he said. "We have given the industry until the 18th of October to respond to us after which we would take an appropriate decision."
