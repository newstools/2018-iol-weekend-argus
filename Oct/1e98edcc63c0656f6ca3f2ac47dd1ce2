Producer Paul Frift said the show did exceptionally well in South Africa because of its relevance. “We came to Cape Town because we know its versatile as a location, we know we are going to get a good product, we are going to get a bang for our buck.” The full cast of Deep State will be in the city for 10 weeks shooting the second season of the 10-episode series. The show, which promises diversity and “allows for critical thinking in a world of uncertainty”, will, according to Frift, provide a realistic view of the world’s current political landscape. The show’s inaugural season garnered exceptional interest from various broadcasters globally, leading to the Fox network greenlighting a second season which is said to air in April next year. The new season will feature two new female characters, Aminata Sissoko, played by Zainab Jah and Aicha Konate, played by Lily Banda. According to the two actors, the characters have allowed them to push boundaries. Sissoko is the chief adviser to the president and Jah said: “I get to play a powerful politician and its my first time and I’m loving it. “This character has helped open my mind to politics because I usually shy away from it.” Konate is a young woman from Mali who works as a translator and finds herself neck deep in conspiracy. “Aicha is really brave and breaks down all barriers. She does not turn away from any problems,” said Banda. Most of the original cast returns, including Joe Dempsie, Karima McAdams, Anastasia Griffith and Alistair Petrie.
