This station is a 24-hour station because of the high demand in the area. Officers Inspector Vuyani Aplom and Germaine Dampies, who were on the 6am to 6pm day shift, clocked in as soon as they arrived and then started to prepare for parade. Dampies said the reason he is passionate about his job and wouldn’t trade it for another profession is that he knows that every day a difference can be made. “People see us, and they know they can ask for help. Just seeing the response when people say thank you and knowing I was part of that relief, makes me feel good as an officer.” The Law Enforcement Department is housed in the Safety and Security Directorate of the city. There are three enforcement arms within this directorate. Law Enforcement, Traffic, and the Metro Police. Law Enforcement has as its primary function, the enforcement of the city’s by-laws. Before mid-morning Dampies and Aplom had already responded to a call near Mnandi Beach, where an alleged robbery had taken place. Law Enforcement responded and handed over to the SAPS. Later, the officers responded to a “6-4 situation” (mentally-ill person) where a woman had taken of her clothes and was running across the N2 and over barriers. Officers managed to stop her and attempted to cover her, which proved to be difficult as she was resisting. After some time paramedics were called to the scene, she was sedated and taken to a hospital. After this, the day was done for the officers and we proceeded back to the station.
