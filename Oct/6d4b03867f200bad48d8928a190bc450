According to his mother, the boy has also gone back to church, stopped hanging out with his old friends and has turned into the “reliable son I know and trust”. His 43-year-old mother, said the teen last visited home during the school holidays in July. “He is doing much better, he took well to the rehabilitation and the classes they attend have assisted him in regaining his self-esteem and he is no longer focused on the anger he had towards his father.” The boy’s anger dated back to the age of 6, when his father denied paternity. Now, the happy mother of three is only worried about his lack of skills when he leaves the facility next year. “He is in a two-year programme where they are taught about how to deal with their issues, put themselves first and resist drugs. But now, my only fear is that he needs something that will make him employable when he leaves there because he may not be able to go back into mainstream education. I wish he could be enrolled in a facility where he learns carpentry because he is very good with his hands and he loves creating and building things,” she said. When Weekend Argus visited the infamous informal settlement of Marikana in October last year, the teen was sitting on his cylinder in the lounge of his home. He had learnt to move around the house with the tank but said he was grateful to his mother for having chained him up. At the time, the boy had admitted to being addicted to methamphetamine (tik) as well as Mandrax. He confessed to having anger issues resulting from his father abandoning him and dropping out of school in Grade 6. He started using drugs and experimenting with benzine in 2015 before leaving school. He would often hide in nearby bushes to smoke with friends during school hours until he eventually quit.
