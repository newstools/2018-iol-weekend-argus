Shakur Hector, 14, is dedicated to his soccer career. It is his dream to one day play at a professional level. Shakur started playing soccer at the age of 9, first playing for Tafelzight FC in Tafelsig. In 2016 he was scouted by Milano United, where he played as a striker. Soon after, he was scouted by Hellenic FC in Milnerton, which is his current club. “It has been a struggle financially for us to send him abroad, but thanks to Simsport International, the Office of the Executive Mayor, and with the support of friends and family, he was able to gain experience on a professional level,” said Shakur’s mother, Tasneema Hector. The team visited Manchester United, Manchester City, Everton FC and Liverpool FC. In England they were welcomed by Bolton Wanderers FC and stayed at the Macron Stadium. They played three games while on tour, including one against the Bolton U17 team. Hector said it wasn’t easy raising him in a community like Mitchells Plain, where they are constantly exposed to crime. “Shakur is determined not to let his area define him Sometimes it’s very difficult for him to take a run or practise on our soccer field,” Hector said. She said Shakur doesn’t want his soccer journey to end. “He would like to reach out to all football clubs, soccer academies, tour companies and sponsors to recognise his potential. “As a parent, I see the love and passion he has for soccer - it’s like he was born to play,” she said. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
