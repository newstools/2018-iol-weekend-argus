Cape Town - The MyCiTi wildcat bus strike has entered its third day, forcing many commuters to find alternative transport. Protesters on Wednesday morning blocked Hertzog Boulevard in Cape Town's CBD. On Tuesday, talks between the City of Cape Town and the leaders of the striking drivers broke down. Striking bus drivers are believed to have roped in members of the EFF, but the bus companies and the City of Cape Town refused to have the political party present in the labour dispute, leading to the talks being deadlocked.
