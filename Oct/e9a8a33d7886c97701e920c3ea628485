Cape Town - With only hours to go, queues persist outside the offices of the South African Revenue Service (Sars) in Cape Town as taxpayers scramble to file their returns ahead of deadline at midnight. SARS has warned taxpayers that those who miss Wednesday's deadline are liable to fines. “SARS has sent reminders to taxpayers who still need to file. After the deadline, administrative penalties will be applied to late returns ranging between R250 and R15 000,” reads their statement. “This year, eighteen taxpayers were prosecuted for not submitting their tax returns as part of SARS’ outstanding tax return campaign. “Employers are also reminded that the deadline for submissions as part of the Employer Interim Reconciliation period also closes on October 31, 2018.” Countrywide offices will remain open until 6pm on Wednesday night while those using efiling have until midnight . For those who would elect to avoid the long queues and file via efiling, SARS says their system has experienced 99.7% uptime during the tax season and is geared to receive large volumes of returns in the upward of 150 000 submissions daily.
