Cape Town - Cheslin Marsh, the only witness to the kidnapping of Hannah Cornelius who was later raped and murdered, recalls closing his eyes while resting his head on a brick, praying, while his attacker stood over his head. “They took me out of the car and led me to a bushy area we stopped by a tree. They then told me to lie on the ground and place my head on the brick. “The two men were each holding a brick. I closed my eyes and prayed. I don't remember what happened afterwards,” Marsh sobbed in the Western Cape High Court on Thursday. He said he only regained consciousness the following afternoon. “My whole body was in pain, but I could stand. I looked around to see where am I, and ran to the first house I saw,” an emotional Marsh said. He remembered climbing the wall to the house and the home owners calling the police. He was rushed to Kraaifontein Day Hospital where he received treatment and was later transferred to Tygerberg Hospital, and later Paarl Hospital. Cornelius was last seen hours before her death with Marsh, before they were brutally attacked by four men while in her car in Bird Street, Stellenbosch. Marsh was found by a couple, Averal and Margaret Fortuin, in Barnardino Heights. He was drenched in blood. He had sustained serious head injuries and a broken arm. Cornelius’s Citi Golf was later believed to have been used in an armed robbery in Northpine, between Brackenfell and Kraaifontein. Vernon Witbooi, Gerald Parsons, Eben Van Niekerk and Nashville Julius are on trial for her murder. Marsh has concluded his testimony. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
