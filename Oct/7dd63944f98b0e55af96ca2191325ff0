Durban - The suspects arrested in connection with a string of incendiary devices planted across Durban were arrested on Friday afternoon and are expected to appear in court next week. The suspects have been linked to the attack on a mosque in Verulam that took place in May. One worshiper was killed and two others injured when three men entered the mosque and attacked them, before setting the mosque alight. Several days later, an incendiary device was found beneath the pulpit of the mosque.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
