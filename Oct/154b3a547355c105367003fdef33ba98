London - She is already an accomplished scene-stealer - so it’s no surprise that Princess Charlotte is at the centre of all the fun in Princess Eugenie’s first social media post since her wedding. The three-year-old is shown laughing as she gazes up at the new Mrs Brooksbank, surrounded by bridesmaids and pageboys. Eugenie is sitting on the floor of Windsor Castle’s White Drawing Room with husband Jack (beside Theodora Williams), while Savannah Phillips wraps her arms around the bride.     Jack and I would like to thank everyone who was involved in making our day so special and for all the wonderful wishes as we start married life laughing together. @alexbramall A post shared by  Princess Eugenie (@princesseugenie) on Oct 16, 2018 at 9:01am PDT Isla Phillips can also be seen at the front. Posting on Instagram, Eugenie, 28, wrote: "Jack and I would like to thank everyone who was involved in making our day so special and for all the wonderful wishes as we start married life laughing together." The informal picture was taken by wedding photographer Alex Bramall on Friday. Another scene stealer was Teddy Williams. The six-year-old daughter of Robbie Williams and Ayda Field, who is seldom pictured in public, made her royal debut as bridesmaid. The splitting image of her dad, young Teddy had a cheeky moment when she asked Sarah Ferguson if she was the Queen. Daily Mail and IOL
