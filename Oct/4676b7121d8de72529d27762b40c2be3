Deon Ganas, owner of the pageant, said Gautam brought the brand into disrepute after she instituted legal action against the organisers, accusing them of not honouring her prizes. “She has been served with the letter. Saumya was in breach of her contract and brought the brand into disrepute by making false allegations,” said Ganas. Gautam served the organisers with summons demanding her prizes, including a vehicle, to be delivered, or alternatively, the value of the car (R419000) be paid. Ganas said a notice to defend has been filed and first princess, Daphnie Singh, would take over the reign.Gautam confirmed the letter but said she declined it.
