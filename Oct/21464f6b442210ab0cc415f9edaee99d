Comedienne Diane Morgan has claimed the bride and groom suggested their male and female attendees - who included the likes of David and Victoria Beckham, George and Amal Clooney, and Serena Williams - wear such products on their big day due to a lack of comfort breaks. Speaking on Ricky Gervais' Sirius XM radio show, after the host told listeners Diane had suggested guests were encouraged to wear nappies, she said: "No, it is not a nappy - it is like a sanitary pad. "You are sat there for about four hours, aren't you? And when they invite you they say we suggest you wear a sanitary pad." Diane also claimed men were encouraged to wear the feminine health products, and she hinted George would've been wearing one. When asked if the 'Gravity' star would've donned a sanitary pad, she replied: "Yeah, I am saying the whole lot of them were." Harry and the duchess - known as Meghan Markle before the wedding - tied the knot at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in May, and guests were said to have been issued with a number of etiquette guidelines ahead of the nuptials. One of which is said to have encouraged them to go to the toilet before they arrive because facilities would be limited. Last month, etiquette expert Myka Meier claimed royals are not allowed to announce their intentions during a meal if they need to leave to use the toilet. They are supposed to simply say "excuse me" before heading off to the restroom.
