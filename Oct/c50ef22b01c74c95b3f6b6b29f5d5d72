Cape Town - With Diwali and Guy Fawkes just weeks away, the City of Cape Town’s Safety and Security Directorate has urged residents to blow the whistle on the illegal sale of fireworks in the interest of public safety. "The City appeals to the public to report information relating to the illegal sale or use of fireworks to the Public Emergency Communication Centre on 021 480 7700 from a cellphone or 107 from a landline," the City of Cape Town said in a statement. "This time of year is generally associated with an increase in the use of fireworks, as Guy Fawkes is on 5 November and the Hindu festival of lights (Diwali) occurs just two days later this year. "In terms of legislation, fireworks can only be discharged at designated sites; should only be purchased at accredited outlets; and cannot be bought or handled by anyone under the age of 16, among other conditions," the City said. Mayoral committee member for safety and security; and social services JP Smith said the reality was, however, very different. "Fireworks are not only a nuisance to many communities, but they present a danger that can result in serious injury or even death," Smith said. "Already this weekend I was alerted to a fire in Ocean View where firecrackers were alleged to have been involved. While we do not have definitive proof, it is still of concern. Fortunately, in this instance, the fire was controlled very quickly and did not require intervention from the Fire and Rescue Service. "While our Law Enforcement staff will act on the illegal sale of fireworks, they can’t be everywhere all of the time and we need the community to be our eyes and ears. So I appeal to residents to report anyone who is illegally selling or using fireworks," he said.    @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
