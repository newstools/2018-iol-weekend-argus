Cape Times – Five people were arrested at the Civic Centre MyCiTi station at midday on Tuesday amid an ongoing illegal strike by drivers demanding insourcing and better working conditions. "The SAPS had to use stun grenades to disperse a group of strikers who were gathering in the red bus lane at the Civic Centre station and preventing buses from operating," the City of Cape Town said in a statement. "These strikers were in defiance of the court order interdicting them from intimidating, harassing or assaulting MyCiTi personnel and passengers; damaging MyCiTi stations, depots and buses; and gathering at or coming closer than 100m from MyCiTi stations, depots or buses." A City employee, who witnessed the incident and wanted to remain anonymous, told the Cape Times "it was disturbing to see people throw stones at MyCiTi commuters and seeing people being forced to scatter in all directions". Subsequently there was a heavy law enforcement presence at the Civic Centre and in Adderley Street. Also in the morning, a MyCiTi bus was stoned in Khayelitsha, but mayoral committee member for transport Brett Herron said no injuries were reported to him, News24 reported. He said buses would now depart from Kuyasa station, with protection from law enforcement. "The N2 express service has operated throughout the week without being impacted by the strike. It seems their (MyCiTi) staff who did not go on strike are targeted for intimidation now," Herron said. "Those who are intimidating or attempting to disrupt services must be arrested." Only the following services are currently in operation: D01, D02, D04 (operating from Adderley via Civic Centre stations), T04, 214, 213, 217, 232, 233, 234, 236 and 237. Cape Times
