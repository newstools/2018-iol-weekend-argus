Durban -Â  Pietermaritzburg businessman Rajivee Soni was sentenced to 30 years in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Friday. Soni was convicted in September for the 2013 murder of Pietermaritzburg doctor Bhavish Sewram. Sewram, a father of two, was killed outside his surgery, in Chota Motala, Raisethorpe in May 2013. On September 19, the Pietermaritzburg High Court found Soni guilty on six charges including murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Soni believed that his wife, Kerusha, and Sewram were involved in a romantic relationship. In 2016, Soni applied for an acquittal on all six charges which was denied. Shortly after his conviction Soni's bail of R100 000 was revoked and he reported to prison. Brian Treasurer, 55, a former policeman, who was found guilty of hiring the hitmen to kill Sewram was jailed for life. Treasurer died in January 2018. Hitmen Mfaniseni Nxumalo is also serving a life sentence. Soni will be eligible for parole after serving half of his sentence, which is 15 years. POST
