Durban - Motorists travelling along the R102 on the Durban north coast are urged to report any suspicious activity on overhead bridges after two rock throwing incidents were reported just days apart. In the first incident, a motorist was left shaken after a rock was thrown onto her windscreen. Reaction Unit SA spokesperson, Prem Balram, they were alerted to both incidents. “One vehicle was damaged by a group of pupils who hurled stones at a passing motorist. Reaction Officers responded to the callout on the R102 in Verulam and searched the area. The pupils had fled prior to our arrival,” he said. Balram said the second rock throwing incident took place along the R102 on the southbound lane near Cornubia. He said no injuries were reported. Provincial police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said a case of malicious damage to property had been reported to uMhlali SAPS for the first attack. “The driver was driving on the N2 northbound between uMhlali and Tinley Manor when she heard a loud bang,” Mbele said. She added that police were not informed about the second incident. Balram has warned drivers to be vigilant when driving under bridges. Daily News
