Levendal, who lived with his family - nine siblings and animals on Red Hill - said he was the only surviving sibling and the possibility of restitution had given his nieces and nephews hope for the future. “The land doesn’t belong to me, it’s for the grandchildren. This was in my father’s will. “When we left, we were angry and heartsore, but I don’t want to go back, it’s got no more feeling for me. “When I lived there, it was good. We had animals, cows, fowls, horses, everything. It was a huge piece of land. When we left, it all had to go. “Now they want to offer us R110 000 for the eight to nine (hectares) of land. It’s too little, it’s worth millions.” Levendal submitted his land claim shortly after applications opened and said representatives from the Land Claims Commission contacted him this year with an evaluation of the land, stating it was only 6.8951 hectares and was valued at R11 625 in 1970, when it was taken. A compensation offer of R110 947 was made to the family. “I don’t want to take the money. The offer was made this year. It’s worth a minimum of R5million. “The land is not for me, it’s for the grandchildren.” The Land Claims Commissioner was unable to comment on the Levendal case before the newspaper went to print. @IamAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
