Cape Town - The Currie Cup final between Western Province and the Sharks at Newlands on Saturday might have added significance as according to the Western Province Rugby Football Union, the game could be the last one the local side play at the ground. This comes as the Western Province Rugby Football Union (WPRFU) said it was awaiting a decision by the City on whether Cape Town Stadium would be the union’s new home. WPRFU president Thelo Wakefield announced last month that the City would reach a conclusion on whether the union could use the venue for Western Province and Stormers fixtures. The City had apparently planned to discuss the move from Newlands at a council meeting on Thursday where Mayor Patricia de Lille’s refusal to leave office dominated the agenda. Wakefield claimed the City had commissioned an investigation into the feasibility of the move to Cape Town Stadium. He is on record as saying a move to Cape Town Stadium - an emotive issue among sport fans in the City - would benefit rugby in the province, as Cape Town Stadium had world-class facilities. But mayco member for assets and facilities management Stuart Diamond has shot down Wakefield’s claim of a City investigation into a move to Cape Town Stadium, and of an imminent decision by the City on whether the union could move to the facility. Diamond said: “There is no such thing as a commission. As stated previously by the City, there is no signed agreement (for the union to move to Cape Town Stadium) in place.” “It is currently in a draft phase, and I cannot divulge any conditions until the Council process has been completed. “No such approval is yet in place and we cannot pre-empt a council outcome.” Asked when the matter would next be discussed by the City, Diamond said: “We would only be able to confirm that closer to the time (of the next council meeting).” The leadership of the rugby union had not responded to queries at the time of going to print.
