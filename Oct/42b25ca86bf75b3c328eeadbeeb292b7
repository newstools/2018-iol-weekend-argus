Cape Town - Geraldo Parsons, one of the men on trial for the murder of Stellenbosch student Hannah Cornelius and the brutal attack on her friend, Cheslin Marsh took the stand today. Cornelius and Marsh were hijacked and kidnapped in a her parked car in the corner of Jan Cillier and Bird Street on May 27, 2017. Cornelius's body was later found dumped near a Koelenhof farm. She had been raped. Marsh was dumped in bushes near Kraaifontein. Parsons detailed to the court what his role was on that fateful night. Parsons and his co-accussed Vernon Witbooi, Eben Van Niekerk and Nashville Julius are on trial facing charges of murder, attempted murder, rape, kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances. All four have pleaded not guilty to the charges. In his testimony he admits to being one of the four men who attacked Cornelius and Marsh, but maintains that Witbooi was the one who threw the stones that left Marsh deaf in the left ear and the one responsible for killing Cornelius. “My intention was to just rob and hijack the car. I wanted to drop them off out of the town centre and take the car with me,” he said. Parsons said he was the designated driver. “My attention was on the road and to keep a watch on police. “Vernon had condoms. He said Hannah said it's okay for us to have sex with her as long as we don't hurt her,” said Parsons. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
