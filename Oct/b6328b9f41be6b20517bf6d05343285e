CAPE TOWN - Sars acting Commissioner Mark Kingon said he had to "unreservedly" apologise to South Africa for the failure in leadership of the tax revenue office. He said that Sars fell short of the "highest standards". Kingon made these emotional statements at the Nugent Commission of Inquiry and in fact, held back tears as he said sorry. The inquiry is looking into the major issues at Sars. "I would like to say sorry on behalf of Sars leadership, I would like to say sorry to the president, the minister of finance, former officials and their families for the fear and pain they were put through." "I would like to say sorry for falling short of the highest standards," he said. It should be noted that Kingon has been acting commissioner since March this year after Tom Moyane was suspended. Kingon wanted to be very clear that the revenue agency is still in aÂ  "tumultuous" position, hopes that this will never happen again. "We need visionary leaders, and we don't have that," he said. "We need vision to take this place forward. The first part of healing is acknowledging that there is a problem." TWITTER REACTION Twitter users have applauded Kingon in his attempts to clean out the problems that Sars is facing.
