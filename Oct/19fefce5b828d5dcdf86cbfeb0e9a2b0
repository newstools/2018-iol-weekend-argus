Durban - More than 15 schoolchildren scrambled out of a mini-bus taxi that ploughed down an embankment and came to rest in a stormwater culvert in Newlands East on Tuesday. The taxi with schoolchildren veered off Musa Dladla (Newlands East) Drive and landed in a culvert at the Pufaro Road recreational grounds. The children were being transported to schools in Newlands East. In a photograph of the scene, none of the children appears to be hurt. They are standing on an embankment overlooking the taxi. Shontel De Boer, Newlands East eThekwini PR Councillor said, previously residents blamed the city for not having speed calming measures on the roads.  De Boer said Musa Dladla (Newlands East) Drive where the incident occurred has more than a dozen speed humps to curtail speeding. She said this collision could have been due to driver error or a mechanical fault in the minibus taxi. Daily News
