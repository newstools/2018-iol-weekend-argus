Johannesburg - Former president Jacob Zuma's house in Forest Town is reportedly up for sale for R6.5 million. The house which is situated in Forest Town, an upmarket suburb in Johannesburg, has been confirmed as up for sale. The Sunday Times reported that the house is up for sale and that the agency running the sale, Firzt Realty, said the house could only be viewed by appointment. Zuma’s spokesperson Vukile Mathabela confirmed to the paper that the house was indeed up for sale. There’s no further information on why Zuma had placed the house on the market. When the house was purchased in 2005, Zuma was not cited as the owner. A company called Hola Recruitment & Selection Services, a recruitment agency, purchased the house for R3.6 million in 2005, according to News24. The company was owned by Zephroma Sizani Dubazana, who was linked to Zuma through her previous employment as Nkosazana-Dlamini Zuma’s personal assistant. The Forest Town house has been the scene for numerous incidents that have plagued the former president. The first was the raid by the Scorpions, a disbanded investigative unit, in 2005 – shortly after Zuma moved into the house. The house is also where Zuma was accused of raping Fezekile Kuzwayo – a charge which he was acquitted of. IOL
