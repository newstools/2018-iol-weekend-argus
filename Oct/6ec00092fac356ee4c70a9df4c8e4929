Palu - The Indonesian government has placed eight conditions for foreign non-profits wanting to assist with the search and rescue mission in Palu. The conditions were amended on Sunday, on the day the 25 Gift of the Givers volunteers reached the city. Ahmed Bahm, Gift of the Givers team leader, said the organisation would change focus to doing humanitarian work as they were not allowed to help with search and rescue. “The team understands that when you enter into disaster zones you may need to adhere to certain rules and regulations. This is no different from any country, you have to fall within their best scope in terms of what they want to do for the disaster. “The team understands that - they have all been on disasters before and things change, we will take it day by day,” he said. The Gift of the Givers has partnered with a registered local NGO, the PPPA. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
