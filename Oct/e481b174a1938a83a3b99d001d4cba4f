The last time they saw Anathi Sikhafungane, from Wallacedene, was when she left for night school classes in Bloekombos on September 12. The family turned to the Cape Times, pleading with anyone with information to come forward. They said they did not receive the assistance they expected from the police. Sikhafungane’s uncle, Michael Sikhafungane, said on Sunday: “We are overwhelmed and can’t believe she has been found. She said that after classes on the 12th she was accompanied by her classmates to (hitch)hike. "A Toyota Avanza stopped and a woman insisted Anathi get in. The woman offered her a drink and that was the last thing she recalls before waking up in a room with no windows and other girls.” He said that on Thursday evening his niece woke up in another car with men and saw Mthatha road signs. “They left her in a field, but she walked to get help. Luckily her phone was with her so she called our family on that side." A case of kidnapping has been opened, said the Pink Ladies Missing Persons Organisation. Police spokesperson André Traut did not respond before the deadline. Cape Times
