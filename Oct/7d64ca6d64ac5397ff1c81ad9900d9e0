Posted by Re/Max agent Amanda Steyn, the advert describes the plot as “one of the very last big stands left in City (sic)”. The advert also claimed that this plot already had community approval, certificates for landscape design, electrical usage, fire and mechanical ventilation, among others. It also claims that the plot has a building plan that includes a “basement with space for 15 cars plus 10 apartments”. Steyn said the owner had said anyone who had problems with the advert should speak to him. She would not put the Weekend Argus in contact with the owner. Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers Association secretary Jacky Poking said they were not opposed to the sale, but they were against the claim that this had been through a public participation process. “We’ve emailed Re/Max to question the advert. People are shocked. The advert appears to have been up on Thursday evening or yesterday morning. The civic association has not given any approval. As a matter of fact, we haven’t even seen the plan, so we haven’t commented on it. “My question is: who gave the approval? It hasn’t been opened for public participation and we haven’t given comment,” Poking said. “Maybe the City of Cape Town has given approval, but even then there must be a public participation process. We have not received notice for comment.” Mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Brett Herron could not give an answer as Poking did not have the exact address at the time of going to print. Herron said: “If the vacant plot is developed, it will need planning approval. What approvals are required depends on the zoning and what an applicant proposes. Public participation is required when a proposed building is not permitted as of right by the zoning of the property. “I do not know the property nor whether any plans have been submitted. The advert suggests that plans have been submitted. Public consultation would follow if the current zoning does not permit what is proposed.” Weekend Argus
