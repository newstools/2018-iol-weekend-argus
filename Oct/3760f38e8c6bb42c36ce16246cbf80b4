Desai was a former player for the renowned DHS Rhythm Club, and he remained an influential figure even after his playing days were over. Going from the playing level through to an administrative level, he served the DHS Rhythm Club for more than 12 years. Desai was also a member of the KZNCU council and an executive member of the eThekwini Metro Cricket District. His involvement in DHS Rhythm started when he was a player at the club before he moved into a management role with the junior teams. The 53-year old then moved up through the club’s administrative structures. At the time of his death, he was serving as the manager of the 1st XI at the club. A dedicated club man, Desai was a popular figure, and carried out his duties without fuss. “We would like to send our condolences to the family and friends of Ayob at this terrible time,” Yunus Bobat said in a statement, on behalf of the KZNCU and eThekwini Metro Cricket District families. “It is a tragedy and a huge loss for those close to him and a terrible loss for cricket in KwaZulu-Natal, we are still in shock. Ayob’s dedication to the game was admirable and there are very few people left that have the same commitment to club cricket. “He was a true gentleman and was never one to raise his voice, he will be sorely missed,” Bobat added, passing on the sincere condolences of the cricket fraternity of KZN to the family. Desai was 53. Sports Reporter
