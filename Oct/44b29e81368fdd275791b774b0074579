Johannesburg - Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba’s spin doctor has indirectly accused the EFF leadership of being behind the leaking of a compromising video that has since gone viral on social media, showing the minister engaging in a sexual act. The EFF has denied involvement, saying anyone with evidence must come forward and prove the party was behind the leak. Gigaba’s spokesperson, Vuyo Mkhize, tweeted yesterday: “The @mgigaba video was leaked by an opposition leader who obtained it from an MP of his party from uMzimkhulu who, in turn, obtained it from a guy who was previously implicated in the failed attempt to blackmail the minister.” On Sunday, Gigaba publicly apologised to the nation and his family for the video, which he said was shot in 2016. Mkhize did not name the MP, the leader of the opposition party or the party they belong to. He said he would comment further only if there were developments. However, Independent Media established that EFF MP Marshal Dlamini is the only opposition MP from uMzimkhulu in the eastern part of KwaZulu-Natal. It is believed the opposition leader Mkhize was referring to is EFF president Julius Malema, who is also the party’s leader in Parliament. IFP MP and spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa and DA KwaZulu-Natal leader Zwakele Mncwango said their parties did not have MPs from uMzimkhulu. However, Dlamini denied having anything to do with the leaked Gigaba video. “Why can’t you ask Vuyo Mkhize to give you the names. You cannot just harass us. I am telling you that you don’t know what you are talking about,” he said. Political Bureau
