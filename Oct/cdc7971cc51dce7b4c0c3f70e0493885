Johannesburg - A taxi driver died in a hail of bullets after three people allegedly ambushed him in Lenasia on Thursday. The incident happened at Golden Highway and Sheffield Road. According to Gauteng police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini, the taxi driver was driving alone. “He was shot before 10am this morning. He was attacked by a group of about three people. He was found alone when police arrived,” Dlamini said. It is not clear if the 56-year-old driver was on duty at the time of the incident. Dlamini refused to give details on how many shots were fired and how many hit the driver. However, Crime Air Network Initiative REZA said on Twitter that the suspects fired 49 shots at the taxi driver and did a victory dance before fleeing the scene. Dlamini said they were still investigating the motive behind the shooting. He said a case of murder and attempted murder has been opened. No arrests have been made. In August, a man was shot 25 times at close range on the Golden Highway. The incident happened in the afternoon while the man was travelling in his white Golf GTI. A murder case was opened at the Eldorado Park police station. @SthembisoMedia The Star
