One Facebook user wrote, "A great loss of an even greater person! Such a kind heart!" While another wrote: "Shareen’s soul was a great one. I really admired her for the person she was. She shined bright even in dark times. I still see her laugh while enjoying the fashion show only three weeks ago. Shareen will surely be missed by many. To her lovely daughters, Zoë and Hanka, may you find peace and inner comfort, she was a gem of a person. All involved at Pali, from the lecturers to the students, its tough and really painful, but stay strong and hold on to her memories and continue to build on what she started, and take Pali to even bigger heights in memory of a great actor and mentor (sic)".
