Durban - A Gauteng drug rehabilitation centre, found to be operating illegally, is expected to be shut down in the next six weeks. This comes after father of three, Muhammed Shaik, 40, died on October 12, two weeks after being admitted to the Magaliesburg Health Centre, a division of the Crescent of Hope South Africa organisation, on September 28. His nephew, Ibrahim Khan, said Shaik was allegedly assaulted a day after he was admitted in attempt to “control” him. Gauteng Social Development Department spokesperson, Mbangwa Xaba, said the centre was in the process off being closed. Investigations found that the centre’s registration had lapsed in January last year, he said. The centre was also ill-equipped to operate as an in-patient treatment centre in terms of the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Dependency Act, Xaba said. Khan said the family, of Lenasia in Johannesburg, were furious because he was placed in the centre in good faith and they have now opened a case of murder. POST
