Cape Town - The Democratic Alliance has congratulated former Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Tito Mboweni on his appointment as Finance Minister but expressed concern over "a little looney posting content that seemed to be at odds with government policy". "With his experience, the new Finance Minister will have the advantage of being able to hit the ground running and is, at least, known to market participants, ratings agencies and international financial institutions, who closely follow events in South Africa." "However, we are concerned that during the years that he was out in the political cold, he often came over on social media, at least, as a little looney posting content that seemed to be at odds with government policy," said DA Shadow Minister of Finance, David Maynier. In April earlier this year, Mboweni tweeted "Dear God, open the eyes and ears of our Leaders’. Let them do four things: The State must own 40% of mining companies, start a State Bank, implement appropriate Land Use Planning and Create a Sovereign Wealth Fund. What is so difficult? That is Radical Economic Transformation!!" The DA called for clarity on this view in the run-up to the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement which is scheduled to take place in two weeks time. President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday appointed Mboweni, a former Reserve Bank governor and labour minister, as finance minister, replacing Nhlanhla Nene who admitted to having meetings with the Gupta family, who are at the centre of alleged corruption. Nene faced calls to resign after he admitted visiting the Gupta brothers, friends of scandal-plagued former president Jacob Zuma who have been accused of high-level influence-peddling, and failing to disclose the meetings earlier. Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing. IOL and Reuters
