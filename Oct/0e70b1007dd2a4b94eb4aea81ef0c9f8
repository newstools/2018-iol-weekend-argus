Cape Town - The son of slain Cape Town high profile lawyer Pete Mihalik has been stabilised and moved from the New Somerset Hospital to another facility for further treatment. The eight-year-old was caught in the crossfire when an unknown gunman opened fire on the vehicle he and his father were in on the corner of Cavalcade and Thornhill roads in Green Point this morning at around 7.35 am. Mihalik, 50, died on the scene and his son was rushed to hospital. A spokesperson for the Western Cape Department of Health, Bianca Gilbert, confirmed that the minor was admitted to the New Somerset Hospital after sustaining a gunshot wound. “The patient was stabilised and transferred to another healthcare facility for further medical treatment,” she said.    Police remain on the scene to comb through the area for any evidence as the manhunt begins for a suspect that was seen fleeing the scene in a metallic grey VW Polo shortly after the incident.
