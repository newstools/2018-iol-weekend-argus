The police officer, who celebrated her 30th birthday earlier this month, has caused a social media stir because of her looks. Sophazi, who works at the Pinetown police station, said social media users were flocking to her place of work to get their documents signed by her. On social media users asked to be handcuffed by her. “When I am out with my friends or even when I am working, I get people looking and pointing at me and asking each other if it really is me,” said Sophazi. “Even during roadblocks, I find people staring and some even scream out ‘Its her,’ said Sophazi.” The officer’s photos have been shared widely by male followers who wrote “feeling safer just looking” about them. An Instagram user recently commented on her page: “I’d commit crime every day just to be arrested by you.” Sophazi said she had Instagram boutiques sending her private messages asking her to be an ambassador for their brands. Several SA policewomen are gaining social media fame, with thousands of users following them. But while comments may be flattering, Sophazi was serious about her work. “I don’t have a problem telling people where to get off. I want to be respected for my job and not my looks.” Two years ago, her Instagram account “Sanelberry” had 593 likes. This changed when she posted a picture of herself in police uniform and received more than 1000 likes. Her most recent picture has received more than 6000 likes. Likes are a “stamp of approval” for Instagram users.  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
