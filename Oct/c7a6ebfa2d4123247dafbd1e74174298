Durban - The first day of the third term school holidays got off to a tragic start for a northern KwaZulu-Natal family after their 16-year-old relative was swept out to sea this afternoon. The search, which began just after 5pm, was called off due to bad light. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson, Paul Herbst, said the youngster from Gledhow, near Stanger, was swimming at around 5pm when he was swept away from the shore. He was swimming at Blythedale beach on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. He said an off-duty police officer saw the young boy being swept out and contacted IPSS Medical Rescue and KwaDukuza Fire and Rescue services. “The IPSS water rescue division, together with KDM lifeguards, responded to the beach and initiated an extensive search. The search was suspended with negative results, due to poor light,” Herbst said. He said lifeguards had already closed the beach and the necessary warning flags were displayed. “Please always adhere to cautionary flags and directives. The search will resume at first light,” Herbst said. Daily News
