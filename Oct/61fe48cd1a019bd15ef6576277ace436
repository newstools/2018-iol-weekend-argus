Johannesburg - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has asserted that charging Bonang Matheba for over a dozen counts of tax evasion is a signal to other dodgers that non-compliance will not be tolerated. Dressed in a suave grey coat and wrapped with a black shawl, Matheba made her first court appearance for alleged tax evasion on Thursday, where the case was postponed to November. The renowned TV personality appeared at the Joburg Commercial Crimes Court, where Magistrate Benita Oswell postponed the case to November 14 following a plea made by Matheba's lawyer, Charl Coetzee, who asked for time to prepare representations. Phindi Mjonondwane, spokesperson for the Gauteng NPA, emphasised that Matheba's case was an example to other people who might want to dodge paying taxes that authorities will not tolerate such behaviour -- regardless of who the implicated person is. "No one is above the law. We are trying to promote tax compliance in South Africa," Mjonondwane said.    Matheba is facing a combined 15 counts of tax evasion-related charges; 11 of which are for her personal taxes and four are related to her company. A warrant of arrest had been issued for Matheba after she failed to appear in court in September as the celebrity was in New York City, US. This warrant was rescinded by Magistrate Oswell, but could be reissued if Matheba fails to appear in November. The outstanding charges relate to the 2008 to 2017 years for her personal taxes, and the reporting period 2014 to 2017 for her company. * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535.
