Meghan Markle’s outspoken sister was turned away by Kensington Palace police guards after showing up uninvited. Samantha Markle, 53, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, told the officers she wanted to confront her half-sister amid a bitter dispute. She reluctantly agreed to leave the palace – home to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – after her partner handed a note to one of the officers, the Sunday Mirror reported. Miss Markle arrived in London two weeks ago and made efforts to speak to Meghan, who she has not seen in more than a decade.   A source told the newspaper: ‘"This was a huge move on the part of Meghan’s sister to try to see her face-to-face and the fact she was turned away speaks volumes. She went to the gates and tried to reason with [the palace guards]." Markle, who describes herself as a mental health counsellor, was not invited to the royal wedding in May. She has previously described her sister as a ‘social climber’. After the Kensington Palace snub last week, she was pictured nearby holding royal merchandise – including masks of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Daily Mail
