Port Elizabeth - Nigerian Pastor Timothy Omotoso’s wife was singled out in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Tuesday when she was reprimanded by Judge Mandela Makaula for interrupting court proceedings while State witness Cheryl Zondi was under cross-examination. Proceedings came to a halt when Makaula reprimanded Taiwo Omotoso who was wearing a bright orange dress. “You sitting between those two gentlemen, stand up!” “Please stop making comments and gestures while this witness is testifying,” said Makaula. The woman shyly raised her hand while Makaula addressed her. Taiwo Omotoso has been seen throughout the trial laughing and smiling during Zondi's testimony. Makaula again butted heads with defence attorney Peter Daubermann on his line of questioning. Daubermann repeatedly asked Zondi why she never told Omotoso to stop raping and sexually assaulting her. The Nigerian pastor faces 63 charges which include human trafficking, rape, sexual assault, racketeering and conspiracy in aiding another person to commit sexual assault. His two alleged henchwomen Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho are accused of recruiting girls from all over the country for purposes of sexual exploitation. The 58-year-old televangelist allegedly trafficked more than 30 girls and women who were from various branches of his church to a house in Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal, where he allegedly sexually exploited them.
