Cape Town - Trains have been suspended on the Khayelitsha line following protests in Philippi since 4am on Monday. According to Metrorail spokesperson, Riana Scott, this is due to protests over the removal of illegal structures on nearby SAPS property. “The issues are unrelated to Prasa. Protesters have been active since 4am this morning, placing obstructions including burning tyres on the railway tracks leading to Chris Hani and Kapteinsklip Stations. A police van tried to disperse the crowds but it was stoned and had to withdraw until reinforcements arrived,” said Scott. The service from Cape Town was also terminated in Langa for over five hours while the situation was being assessed. “We were forced to terminate trains from Cape Town at Langa until the crowds were dispersed. Only then could our technical crews clear the tracks and verified that it was safe to operate trains.” Meanwhile, MyCiTi bus commuters have for the second week been urged to continue making alternative travelling arrangements as the service is not fully functional. Last week some MyCiti bus drivers who are employed by the Vehicle Operating Companies (VOCs) operating the MyCiTi bus routes embarked on a wildcat strike. “It is unclear for how long the illegal strike will continue, and when the MyCiTi service will be able to resume normal operations. The City is monitoring the situation and will inform commuters accordingly," councillor Brett Herron said in a statement. Weekend Argus
