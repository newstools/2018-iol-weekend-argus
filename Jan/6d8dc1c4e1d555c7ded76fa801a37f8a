The City of Cape Town’s primary source of water is hovering at a mere 14% capacity according to the City’s water dashboard. The 25-metre-deep Theewaterskloof Dam near Villiersdorp forms part of the Western Cape water-supply system, which comprises six dams.   Sputnik Ratau, spokesperson for the national Department of Water Sanitation, said the Theewaterskloof was completed in 1980 and has a full supply capacity of 480 million cubic metres. Ratau said the Western Cape water-supply system comprises six large dams, the upper and lower Steenbras and the Wemmershoek Dams, owned by City, and the Theewaterskloof, Voëlvlei and Berg River dams, owned by the department. “In addition, there are a number of smaller dams and weirs,” he said. The Weekend Argus visited the Theewaterskloof Dam this week. The drought has painted a shocking and somewhat eerie picture. An old vineyard once covered in water has now been exposed . The vineyard had been underwater since the dam was built and, for the first time in decades, has been exposed to the glaring sun. “Before the dam was constructed the farms on the surface area were expropriated. “At that time, the area was fully cultivated. The decision taken was to only expropriate the areas under the high floodline and not the full extent of the farms. “That allowed the farmers not to lose too much land and to continue with their farming,” said Ratau.
