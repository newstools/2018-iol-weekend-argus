Johannesburg - Two Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officers were killed after an alleged drunk driver crashed into a roadblock in Paulshof, it emerged on Tuesday. The incident reportedly happened on Monday night along Witkoppen Road after the driver of a Toyota Hilux double cab drove into a group of officers, a BMW, Hyundai and a Porsche, which had been stopped by officers. ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said when paramedics arrived at the scene shortly before 9pm, they found several vehicles involved in the collision. "The exact circumstances surrounding the incident is not yet known; however, it is believed that a vehicle crashed into the roadblock, killing two officers and injuring occupants of vehicles that were parked at the roadblock. "Sadly, there was nothing that paramedics could do for the two officers and they were declared dead at the scene. Another officer was assessed on scene and found to have only sustained minor injuries. Three occupants from one of the stationary vehicles had to be rescued by the local fire department and one of them was in a serious condition. "Three others were assessed on scene for injuries ranging from minor to moderate. The injured were later transported to a nearby hospital for further care. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar confirmed the incident, adding that the driver of the Hilux was arrested at the scene, taken for a blood sample and detained at the Sandton Police Station. Head of JMPD David Tembe also commented on the matter, saying: " I don't know what to say anymore when we have to lose our own while serving the community and while we are trying so hard to stop drunken driving and to reduce fatalities . But we will continue to perform our duty and to serve our community". IOL
