DURBAN - A six year old girl who was bitten by a Mozambique spitting cobra after which the snake spat into her eyes, is presently recovering in hospital following her ordeal with one of Africa's most dangerous snakes. Mikayla Grove, who lives on a farm in Esenembe, was a victim of the snake bite during the early hours of Sunday, while she was asleep. Snake catcher Neville Wolmarans who operates in the Ballito and surrounding areas, was called to the scene shortly after the incident occurred. “By the time I got to the home, Mikayla’s parents rushed off to the hospital. The snake was caught shortly thereafter. It was still on the bed where Mikayla was bitten and it had slithered underneath duvets,” said Wolmarans. Mikayla’s father, Ludwig Grove, said Mikayla was conscious and showed improvement today. “She was taken off the ventilator not too long ago. She is able to recognise her family and the tissue damage seems to be controlled. When the incident happened, Mikayla screamed in her sleep and her mom rushed to her room in response. This is when we discovered the snake bite. Her sister Izabella was also asleep in the room at the time,” said Grove. He said it was a traumatic experience for his family. Wolmarans said Mozambique Spitting Cobras were common in the area in which the snake was found, and that it was not the first time that he had been called to the farm. He said many of the snakes were caught during the December period. nabeelah.shaikh@inl.co.za SUNDAY TRIBUNE
