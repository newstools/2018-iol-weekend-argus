Johannesburg - EFF national spokesperson Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has been named the Most Influential Young South African for 2017. Ndlozi takes over from comedian Trevor Noah who won the prize in 2016. Ndlozi was awarded the honour after topping a poll by Avance Media, a social enterprise in partnership with various organisations aiming to show the growing potential of young people. The poll was open to public participation from about 90 countries, and had several categories, namely Business, Law and Governance, Science and Technology, Entertainment, Media, Leadership and Civil society, Social Enterprise and Philanthropy, Personal Development and Academia, Sports as well as Lifestyle. Bafana Bafana and Sundowns midfielder Percy Tau was ranked second overall and won the Sports category. Actress and model Nomzamo Mbatha took third spot and first in the Lifestyle category. Dr Sandile Kubheka, an Intensive Care Unit medical officer at Grey Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal scooped the fourth position and took first place in the Science and Technology category. In 2013 Kubheka became the youngest ever doctor to qualify for MBChB at the age of 20 and is now the ambassador for the SA National Blood Service. Popular rapper Cassper Nyovest occupied the fifth spot and was awarded first place in the entertainment category. According to Avance Media, this is thanks to his uplifting story of dropping out of high school in North West and relocating to Johannesburg where he built his music empire and started the #FillUp series of music concerts. Other names on the list worth noting are DJ Zinhle at position 8, TV personality Bonang Matheba (9), athlete Caster Semenya (10), rapper AKA (12), Miss Universe 2017 Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, musician Babes Wodumo (19) and cricketer Kagiso Rabada (31).  lindile.sifile@inl.co.za  @lindilesifile The Star
