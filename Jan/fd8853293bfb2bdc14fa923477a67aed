A confident and beaming Nel-Peters said she never doubted for one minute that she would win the coveted title which was held in Las Vegas in November last year. “When I heard Steve Harvey utter the words South Africa, I realised it was a victory for South Africa,” said Nel-Peters when asked what her immediate thoughts were after she was announced the winner. Nel-Peters said since her crowning she has travelled to many countries but her main focus is her “Unbreakable” campaign which aims to empower women when they were faced with life-threatening situations. Nel-Peters herself overcame an attempted hijacking last year and this is the main reason behind her campaign to empower women.   “We kicked off our Unbreakable campaign in Johannesburg yesterday and today we will launch the Cape Town leg. This campaign speaks to a global audience and I am going to use the platform that I have been given to elevate that cause” said Nel-Peters. So far, she has met former Miss SA and Miss Universe 1978, Margaret Gardiner, Kendall Jenner and singer Kelly Clarkson. “Kelly loves hippos,” Nel-Peters blurted out, laughing, almost afraid she would forget the thought. Nel-Peters will also be a huge attraction at the Sun Met at Kenilworth Racecourse today where she will rub shoulders with eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt. “I am a big fan and I cannot wait to meet him and just get to know him as a person,” added Nel-Peters. The new Miss Universe will head to her family home in Sedgefield on Sunday and while she does not know what the family has planned, plans have been made. “My mom does not want to leak anything. I cannot wait to go home and see my family.” Weekend Argus
