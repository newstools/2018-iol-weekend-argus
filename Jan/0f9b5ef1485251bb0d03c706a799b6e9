Durban - President Jacob Zuma will deliver the State of the Nation Address (SONA), and there has been no decision to recall him, said ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule. Magashule spoke to The Mercury in Durban after the press briefing to introduce KwaZulu-Natal’s ANC provincial task team to take over the operations of the suspended provincial executive committee. “He will deliver the State of the Nation Address as he is still the president (of the country),” he said. There has been speculation that Zuma would either be recalled or pushed to resign before the SONA on February 8. It was also believed that he might deliver the address as his farewell. However, Magashule said the future of Zuma did not depend on what the majority of the NEC feels and instead this was only dependent on the outcome of the engagement between both presidents.
