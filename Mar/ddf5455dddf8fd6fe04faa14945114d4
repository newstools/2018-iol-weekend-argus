The official opening of the plant took place on Thursday, but the hospital has been off the grid since Monday. Anthony Futte, the hospital's project manager, said it decided on the water filtration plant at the beginning of 
last year as the drought crisis escalated. He said administrators were concerned that should Day Zero arrive and they were not off the grid and self-sustainable, the hospital might not be able to treat patients. From Monday to Friday, he said the hospital was usually at 80% capacity, and was able to accommodate 300 patients. It has 124 medical suites and 400 staff, and at least 2000 vehicles entering the facility daily. Futter said the hospital decided to dig a second borehole on site; water supplied from its existing one was high in iron. To ensure the water is of a high quality for drinking, it undergoes a thorough filtration process, he added. According to a statement, the primary treatment involves iron removal through a specialised system. The water flows into a holding tank. From there, it is pumped to the pre-filtration. At this stage, it uses a set of three filters and pushed through two ultra-filtration modules - this is the final treatment step. The water is stored in potable water tanks, where it is distributed into the hospital network. According to Futter, the system cost R2 million and the hospital would save about R90000 a month on water costs. Gugu Phakathi, a project engineer at Murray & Roberts, said the water filtration system was able to pump out 192kl of water per day. A similar filtration system is being installed at Life Vincent Pallotti Hospital’s sister hospital, Life Kingsbury. Lourens Bekker, Life Healthcare chief executive for Southern Africa, said it has a back-up plan should any problems arise with the filtration plant: “We have an emergency storage supply at the hospital, which is sufficient for at least 48 hours."
