Nutritionist and cookbook author Leanne Katzenellenbogen shared lunch box ideas from Fabulous Lunch Box Ideas sans processed meats. Sweet chilli chicken burger 1 low-GI hamburger bun 1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce 1 home-made chicken burger patty; 2 medium slices tomato 3-4 medium slices cucumber 12 medium carrot, grated  Method Cut the bun in half and spread sweet chilli sauce over one half. Place the burger patty on top of the sweet chilli sauce. Top with the tomato and cucumber slices. Top with the grated carrot and close with the remaining half of the bun. Hint: You can send the individual burger components in the lunch box and allow your child to assemble the burger at school - but be careful, because if left to their own devices they may not add the vegetables.  Tuna, cucumber and corn on low-GI seed bread A thin spread extra-lite margarine 6 slices low-GI seed bread 3 medium slices cucumber, diced 2 tbsp whole kernel corn 3 tbsp reduced-oil mayonnaise 1 x 119 g can shredded tuna in brine, drained  Method Spread a thin layer of margarine over each slice of bread. Mix the cucumber, corn, mayonnaise and tuna. Divide the mixture into 3 portions and spread each portion on to a slice of bread. Top each sandwich with the remaining slices of bread and cut diagonally into triangles. Makes 3 sandwiches. - Weekend Argus Reporter
