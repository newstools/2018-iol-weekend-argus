The 19th edition of the annual event attracted approximately 37000 people to watch 41 musical performances on five stages on two nights. This year jazz enthusiasts took as many videos and pictures as possible and embraced many of the stages that weren’t hosting pure jazz acts. Amanda Black and 
Black Motion were particular fan favourites on the first night. Dance music duo Black Motion in particular drew in a younger crowd on Friday night, along with jazz fusion artist Jordan Rakei. Settlers High School Band opened last night  on the Basil “Manenberg” Coetzee stage with their performance in the style of American disco group Earth, Wind and Fire. British award-winning artist Corinne Bailey Rae wowed the Kippies stage crowd with her repertoire, while Simphiwe Dana was on the same stage earlier in the evening. One of the highlights 
of the evening was The Boy’s Doin’ It: A Celebration of Hugh Masekela’s Life and Music performance featuring 
artists who had worked with the legend who died in January. The songs performed were a combination of those that resonated with the fans or had significant meaning to the artists who had worked with him. The performance featured singer Sibongile Khumalo, who had collaborated with Masekela. She said that the performance was about a great musician and humanitarian. “One of his biggest messages was the appreciation of heritage. I think that’s one thing that Bra Hugh taught us - remember who you are,” she said. Khumalo added that there was room for more projects like this in the future. American hip hop artist Masego, who performed on the Moses Molelekwa stage, said that he takes a piece of culture with from every place he travels to and incorporates it into his music. “You can always over-think making music. The more I travel I take a piece of everywhere I go and when I came out here I became really interested in rhythms. "A lot of my melodies come from London and Amsterdam,” he said.
