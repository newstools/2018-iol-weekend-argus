The theme this year, Mother City, Mother Nature, was chosen to “shine a light on our relationship with nature, with each other and with the city we call home”, said the event’s community facilitator, Angie Petersen. “Cape Town’s drought has made everyone more aware of our reliance on nature. “Now it’s time for us to strengthen and affirm our connection with each other in the greater community and decide what it really means to be in the Mother City.” The event began in 2010 out of the “gees” of the 2010 Fifa World Cup, as an opportunity to bring South Africans together, through community, culture and creativity. “The Cape Town Carnival, held annually in March, is now the country’s pre-eminent street parade. It showcases and celebrates the vibrant diversity of Cape Town - and South Africa - with more than 40 community groups, spectacular floats, giant puppets and extravagant costumes, bringing the Green Point Fan Walk alive,” said Petersen. “Thousands of spectators from all over the world converge along the 1.2km parade route. The Cape Town Carnival is a jewel event of Cape Town and a provincial flagship project of the Department of Arts and Culture. Construction of the Cape Town Carnival floats emphasises recycling and upcycling of material.” The carnival also provides a great platform for local community groups to participate. Fifteen floats and more than 30 puppets took part. One of the lead performers, Lisa Marais, a Latin dancer, has performed at the carnival since its inception in 2010. She also performed in the Rio Carnival in 2013 and said the Cape Town Carnival had the potential to grow to that status. Mayor Patricia de Lille said every year 45000 Capetonians and international guests attended and 1600 jobs 
were created.
