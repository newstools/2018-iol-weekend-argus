Jazz festivities are in full swing in the city. They started with a free community concert on Tuesday at Greenmarket Square, where the likes of espYoungLegends 2018 winner Jarrad Ricketts and Alistar Izobell performed. Some of the swankiest fashion threads around were spotted at the CTICC at the festival’s gala dinner on Thursday. This year’s theme was “Sophiatown”, celebrating the legendary era of jazz, black culture and fashion in Joburg. Guests arrived dressed to impress in vintage outfits. The collaboration between #CTIJF2018 and WEAR South Africa, an initiative that supports and promotes locally manufactured clothing and brands, is the main fashion event during the jazz festival. Guests were encouraged to wear proudly South African brands for the dinner to show their support for the local clothing business. Brands under the WEAR South Africa banner showcased their collections, including Namesake, Blue Collar White Collar, Magents, Isabel de Villiers and swimwear label Naked Wear. Attended by socialites, government ministers, Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers’ Union employees and industry-related guests, the dinner was a must-attend to kick-start the jazz weekend. The winners of the GQ and Glamour Best Dressed award were Wesley Talken, who was dressed in a Blue Collar White Collar blazer and shirt, and designer Maloti Mothobi. During his keynote speech at the dinner, Minister of Economic Development Ebrahim Patel observed how important it was for consumers to support the local manufacturing industry as it contributed to job creation and othe economy.
