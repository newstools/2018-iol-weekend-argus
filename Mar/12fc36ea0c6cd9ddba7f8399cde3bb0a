The United People’s Safety Front, an organisation made up of neighbourhood watches, community policing forums, street committees and NGOs held its inaugural safety summit in Pinelands yesterday with the aim of bringing together community workers to discuss challenges and ways to ensure improvement in policing in areas crippled with crime. The organisation said ongoing gang violence, violence against women and children and drug abuse were  threatening to bring certain areas close to collapse. They listed 29 areas within the Western Cape, including Nyanga, Khayelitsha, Philippi and Mitchells Plain that need urgent intervention. Chairperson Llewellyn McMaster said: “There is a deep sense that the state has failed communities and police are not really doing what they are supposed to do. In some communities residents are taking the law into their own hands and we do not want that. “We want the state to provide safe spaces for our people. We decided it is time to unite communities to tell the state, 'This is what we want.'" Addressing the meeting, former finance minister Trevor Manuel said the forum was an important aspect of community safety because it provided a platform for the exchange of ideas and experiences. “It should also be a forum for training and learning. We need to be better at what we do,” he said. “The situation is getting worse for poor people, more drug dealing, more gangsterism. We look towards organisations to help improve the situation."
