Various people reported seeing Gigaba in Cape Town on the day he told Speaker Baleka Mbete he was ill and could not attend to answer questions on the naturalisation of the Gupta family. On Friday Parliament’s spokesperson, Moloto Mothapo, would not say if there had been a response from Deputy President David Mabuza after a complaint by Mbete. Opposition parties are expected to raise the matter on Wednesday with Ramaphosa, and with Mabuza when he is in Parliament on March 20 to answer questions. They have called for Gigaba’s head after he said the Guptas were not South African citizens. After it was proved that Atul Gupta had a South African passport and was a registered voter, the Department of Home Affairs had to issue a correction. The opposition refused to be addressed by Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Fatima Chohan. Gigaba is facing a tough week as he is expected to appear before the inquiry into state capture on Tuesday.
