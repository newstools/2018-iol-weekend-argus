He has entertained Beyoncé, Jay Z, Mango Groove and former president FW de Klerk. “I studied magic from the age of five. My grandparents bought a magic set from Israel and that is how I started. After I finished school I started studying mentalism and learnt from masters,” said Soffer. He describes himself as a mentalist and after being inspired by David Copperfield as a child Soffer decided to enrol at the College of Magic at the age of 13 to study the  craft. He graduated four years later with the prestigious Silver Medallion, which is the highest accolade given by the college. Soffer began performing on the radio and TV and could make light bulbs burst, TVs switch on and bend spoons and forks over the airwaves. “I think I was the first mentalist to do what I do over the radio. “There was one instance where I was talking to a lady who had called in and she was shocked when her toothpaste exploded,” he said. He averages around 150 performances a year for corporates. “I am looking at creating a theatre performance again in the near future because I haven’t done one for so long,” he said. Soffer describes a mentalist as someone who does “magic of the mind”, this includes reading minds, bending metal, manipulating matter and predicting future events.
