Durban - Former president Jacob Zuma will be in Durban this week to receive two awards from controversial Durban-based organisations which have used violence to intimidate Indian and white-owned businesses, all in the name of “radical economic transformation”. The National Funeral Practitioners Association of SA (Nafupa SA), Delangokubona SA Business Forum and Unemployed People’s Trust held a press briefing on Sunday. Nafupa SA president Muzi Hlengwa said 17 like-minded organisations had agreed to honour Zuma for the “sterling work he did while he was the president”. Hlengwa said Zuma would receive achievement and bravery awards during a gala dinner at the Olive Convention Centre where guests had been asked to dress formally in navy and blue. “It is under Jacob Zuma that we got this 30% for black entrepreneurs. Today there is no road construction that can take place in your areas without black companies being involved, which is something we treasure most,” said Hlengwa. He said Zuma would be awarded for being the first president to get white people to march when he talked about radical economic transformation. “Jacob Zuma is the father of radical economic transformation. Jacob Zuma is the first president to ever talk about expropriation of land without compensation,” he said. He said through Zuma’s efforts, white people would see Nafupa SA “radically and forcefully” at the forefront of land grabs, “whether it is at the expense of food or at the expense of our economy”. “It does not matter, we are taking our land back,” he said. Hlengwa said he met Zuma on Friday where the latter expressed his support for Delangokubona’s activities. “He wants us to achieve what we want to achieve. “We disrupt black hunger, we disrupt white and Indian superiority,” he said. Delangokubona secretary Thulani Myeza said Zuma deserved the awards because of his push for black people to own financial institutions. The Mercury
