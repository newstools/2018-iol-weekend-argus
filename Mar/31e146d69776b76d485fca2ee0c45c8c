This year, Inxeba garnered top votes from the judging panel. The acclaimed yet contentious movie which explores issues around the Xhosa circumcision ritual and rites of passage for young men 
as well as homosexuality, was nominated in eight categories at this year’s awards and won most. John Trengrove took home the golden horn for Best Achievement in Directing - Feature Film. Other wins included Best Achievement in Scriptwriting - Feature Film and Best Editing. It was the movie’s leads, Nakhane Touré and Bongile Mantsai, who earned the greatest praise for their powerful performances, walking off with Best Actor in a Feature Film and Best Supporting Actor in a Feature Film awards. Rounding off a spectacular awards evening for cast and crew was the Best Feature Film gong. Since its release earlier this year, Inxeba was taken off circuit and screenings were cancelled at major cinemas following threats of protest by traditionalists; film-makers and actors were inundated with death threats and the film received a X rating (changed to an 18 age restriction).
