However, the reality is insufficient winter rains, empty dams and if people do not continue to save water, Day Zero is a real threat come the summer. Weekend Argus spoke to an expert about what the future held for the province and the city’s water security. Kevin Winter, from UCT’s Environmental and Geographical Science Future Water Institute, said Cape Town would struggle to become a “water secure city in the long-term” 
if climate predictions were correct. He said climate predictions forecast “a warmer, drier and more drought prone (city) in two to three decades”. He called for better management of dams by the Department of Water and Sanitation. “If more than twice the amount of rainfall falls in the city, even in a time of drought, than what we need, then we need to get smarter about how we capture the water. “If we could manage and monitor the recharge of the Cape Flats Aquifer, it might be possible to extract as much as 30% of our water needs each year from this large underground source.” However, Western Cape Premier Helen Zille said she sees Cape Town on course to “becoming the world’s most water resilient city”. Xanthea Limberg, mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services and energy said the view of Cape Town compared to a few months ago, had been changing. Anglican Archbishop Thabo Makgoba of Cape Town said the drought had been a crisis, but it had also been an opportunity to learn important lessons - water is sacred.
