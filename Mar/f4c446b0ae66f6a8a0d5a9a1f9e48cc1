Johannesburg - Continous rains have resulted in flash floods in parts of Johannesburg and authorities on Friday warned motorists to be cautious because many low-lying bridges had become flooded. Power outages in some northern suburbs, including Northcliff, have been reported. In Melrose, a tree fell onto a car. It was not clear if anyone had been injured. The SA Weather Service has flagged the Free State, North West, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal for possible flooding due to the heavy rainfall. Ekurhuleni Emergency Services spokesperson William Ntladi said teams have been sent to problem areas to be on standby.

EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said: “Disaster management monitoring teams have been dispatched to all seven regions of the city to monitor any eventuality and to facilitate evacuation procedures whenever there might be a need to do so since there's a possibility of localised flooding.”    Johannesburg metro police department spokesperson Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said it was mostly plain sailing on the roads except for a few areas in the north where flooding had been reported. Minnaar said Leeuwkop Road in Sunninghill as well as Witkoppen Road were flooded, leading to high traffic volumes in the area. “Our officers are on the scene directing traffic. There has also been flooding on Old Pretoria Main Road and Olifantsfontein. Only one lane is open on Old Pretoria Road.”  Minnaar said 15 accidents had been reported between 3pm and 5pm on Thursday. “The worst accident was a collision between two taxis in Mulbarton in which eight people were injured.” He urged motorists to keep a safe following distance in traffic and to keep their headlights on. * This is a developing story The Star and ANA
