Ladies, I have bigger pants too, if that's your thing!.http://bit.ly/2leCOkL A post shared by  myleeneklass (@myleeneklass) on Feb 7, 2017 at 2:14am PST Massive day! The launch of my very own fitness workout! https://www.mybodybymyleene.com For me, body positivity is so important. It can be debilitating for so many, disheartening or unachievable. Itâ€™s time to take back the power and own our bodies. We make babies, we work, we raise families, we run ourselves ragged looking after our loved ones and keeping a household. Itâ€™s not about what anyone else thinks but how we ourselves feel. This work out is manageable, realistic and most importantly, gets results. I am inspired by all the strong, capable woman around me and wanted to pass that feeling on to those who are not feeling so great, want a change, a challenge or just to feel good and strong. ðŸ’ª #mybodybymyleene @mybodybymyleene A post shared by  myleeneklass (@myleeneklass) on Feb 2, 2018 at 12:43am PST
