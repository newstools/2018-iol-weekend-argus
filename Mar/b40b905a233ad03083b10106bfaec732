The younger, Sylvia Leslie, is a retired legal secretary from Somerset West who has been cycling for 20 years. Now 80 years old, she has taken part in 11 Cycle Tours. “I started cycling when I was about 60 and I very much enjoy it,” she said. Leslie said her primary motivation for participating was the atmosphere. “The cycle tour has excellent organisation and 
excellent crowds, there’s so much hype. It’s just a day to remember,” she said. Leslie also raises money for charity organisations in Somerset West in the weeks before the cycle tour and has managed to raise more than R5000 in donations. She will ride with her family tomorrow and hopes to complete the route within seven hours. She said it would be her last race. “I wanted to complete my last tour before I turned 80, but I missed last year’s event and so I had to make this year my last.” The elder of the entrants is 87-year-old Edwin Tomlinson. The Rondebosch resident has been cycling since he was nine. “I did lots of adventurous things in my day. I used to sail, mountaineer and I’m interested in philosophy. “Now it’s only cycling for me,” said Tomlinson.
