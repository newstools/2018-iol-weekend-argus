The 18-karat trophy, which weighs 6.1kg and is 36.7cm, was on display at the Newlands cricket ground yesterday. Fans posed with the iconic trophy that depicts two humans holding up the Earth. This year's edition of football’s showpiece event is set for June in Russia. The global tour began its African journey last month in Sudan with the South African leg beginning on Friday in Johannesburg. Event spokesperson Michelle Cloete said the tour was about celebrating the legacy of the Fifa World Cup. “I have to say the emotions that you see on people’s faces when they realise it’s the real trophy is  priceless,” she said. Yesterday’s activities included five-a-side football, interactions with Zabivaka the 2018 tournament mascot, foosball, dancers, and a gaming station with the latest Fifa-approved video game. Clyde Curran said the experience reminded him of the 2010 tournament. “It’s been amazing. There’s just this same vibe and feeling and although the World Cup may not be in South Africa, it feels as though it will be," he said. "I’ve enjoyed the fire dancers the most, they’ve been entertaining but what I’m here for is definitely the trophy." The event ended with a concert and performance from hip-hop artist Cassper Nyovest that included a local version of the World Cup anthem, Colours, which he collaborated with American R&B star Jason 
Derulo. It was the first time that Colours was performed with its official release set for March 16. The trophy tour continues tomorrow when it will be on display in Kampala, Uganda.
