This week Kriel said that although they were against the display of the flag, they felt that criminalising it would be going a step too far. “We don’t use the flag at any of our events and we are not in support of it, but banning it would be against freedom of speech and would make South Africa look like a police state. We won’t take a decision to challenge the court application today, but it is something we will consider,” said Kriel.
