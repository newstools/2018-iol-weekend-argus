Buchan, who has come under fire in the past for his alleged homophobic and misogynistic comments, alleged that God was not happy with Cape Town. He has claimed that the Western Cape is experiencing a drought due to murder, prostitution, drugs, racism, the gap between the rich and poor, disrespect for human life, gangsterism and the abuse of women and children. Last year, he prayed for rain and said by March this year the dams would be full. At yesterday’s event, people came prepared for rain. When a few light showers fell, a sea of umbrellas could be seen in the crowd and people lifted their hands in praise as they relished the water on their faces. A number of dignitaries were in attendance, including Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille, Bantu Holomisa and Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The crowd sang along with various bands and, when their members prayed individually, Buchan said “it sounded like music from heaven”. “God gave me a word for the people of Mitchells Plain. Mitchells Plain will be the flower of Cape Town. People will come from overseas to see what God has started in Mitchells Plain.” He told those in attendance that they needed to say sorry to God, as the drought was not the problem of the government. “It is your problem and it is my problem. No repentance, no rain.” During the event, he called on all gang leaders to come forward for prayer. “Gang leaders are leaders, they are just going the wrong way. God will exchange that gun for a Bible.” A few men and women walked to the front, but it was unclear what their affiliation was to the gangs. Buchan prayed for them and gave them his boots, hat, shirt, Bible and jacket. Richard Bosman, executive director for safety and security in the City, said: “Staff were on duty from 4am until the event closed and there were more than 200 security personnel. There were some minor medical incidents (and) one person was removed from the event as he was intoxicated.”
