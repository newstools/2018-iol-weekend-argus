CAPE TOWN - Instant messaging app, WhatsApp now reportedly allows you to delete messages an hour after you sent them, instead of seven minutes, reports The Verge. The app which introduced the “delete for everyone” feature last year, allowed people to delete messages seven minutes after it was sent. This would then delete the message from the receiver’s end. However, The Verge reports that WhatsApp has allegedly changed its delete feature. The “delete for everyone” feature now reportedly allows users to delete messages an hour, eight minutes and 16 seconds after sending it. This will give people more time to delete messages sent by mistake. The feature is reportedly available for iOS update 2.18.31 on AppStore.
