Where a school sandwich was a matter of slicing polony or ham and placing it between two slices of bread, parents now have to think a little harder. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has urged people to avoid eating ready-to-eat meats such as polony, viennas, Russians and other sausages. The recall of ready-to-eat meats has forced people to rethink their options, said Ilhaam Banoobhai-Anwar, a Cape Peninsula University of Technology culinary lecturer and food blogger. She said parents should not be alarmed by the product recall but should rather focus on planning their family meals ahead of time and to creatively come up with alternatives. With time, peanut butter and jam sandwiches will become a bore and instead of missing polony in their sandwiches, families should try other fun and interesting recipes. “I would advise parents to consider things like mini-pizzas, wraps, mini-quiches for the little ones and warm and cold salads for themselves,” said Banoobhai-Anwar. Not only are wraps and quiches an opportunity for parents to hide vegetables in the school meals, but also for parents to explore the kitchen on a budget. To make mini-quiches, you need to mix eggs, milk, vegetables, salt to taste and bake in a muffin pan, said Banoobhai-Anwar. When making sandwiches, think of them as three parts - the base, the spread and the filling, she said. For a smooth spread, parents can use hummus, mayonnaise or guacamole; pilchards or chicken accompanied by lettuce or peppers could serve as a filling. Bread can be substituted with rolls, pita bread or flatbread, or ordinary bread be cut into interesting shapes. Leftover stews and curries can also be packed in a toasted sandwich for lunch the next day.
