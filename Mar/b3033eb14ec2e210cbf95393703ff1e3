This follows a notification earlier yesterday from a Winelands District environmental health practitioner after the presence of the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes was identified in an initial testing of a single batch of red viennas. Shoprite said further testing was necessary to confirm the presence of harmful levels of listeria,  which would take another five working days. As an added precautionary measure, Shoprite has removed all Farmer’s Deli red and smoked viennas from its shelves until the products get the all-clear. According to Shoprite, Listeria monocytogenes is not the same as Listeria ST6, which was linked by the Department of Health to fatal listeriosis cases that occurred in South Africa. Shoprite said the recall due to Listeria monocytogenes was based on a single batch and was not linked to the recent Listeria ST6 recall related to Enterprise Foods. “The production facility where this batch was packed has provided a full record of clean food safety tests which included testing for the presence of listeria bacteria,” it said. “The Shoprite Group has invited any concerned customers to return purchases of any Farmer’s Deli 500g and 1kg red and smoked vienna products for a full refund. Proof of purchase will not be required.”
