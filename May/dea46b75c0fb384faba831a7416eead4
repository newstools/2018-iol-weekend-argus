The number of tourists who visited the countrylast year, saw a disappointing increase of around 2.4% compared to a world trend of 7%. One of the apparent major contributing factors to the low numbers was the water crisis in the Western Cape and high crime. This week the Western Cape Department of Economic Development and Tourism addressed the Provincial Legislature’s standing committee on the impact of crime in the province. The UK government’s travel advisory warns its citizens to be vigilant while visiting South Africa, citing high crime rates such as rape and murder. It also cautions tourists who hike up Table Mounting to be aware of attacks on the mountain. In the Western Cape, ATM fraud, bus attacks and incidents on Table Mountain were listed as areas that needed attention to secure the safety of tourists visiting the province. Nezaam Joseph, chief director for economic sector support said, based on a study conducted on the impact of crime on tourism, it was found that 42% of responded turned down a destination because of a perception on crime, which has drastic economic consequences. “We know that tourists spend between R20 billion and R30bn per year and if you reduce that by 1%, you get a R200m difference. “So that gives you an idea of the impact of crime on tourism that if there is a 1% reduction due to crime,” he said. Owner of Khayelitsha Travel Loyiso Mfuku said it was the perception of rampant and violent crime rather than targeted attacks that fuelled fear. “We have noticed recently that there have been baseless attacks on the tourism economy in Khayelitsha. You find tour operators have drivers who are too scared to come here based on claims that are not verified around buses being robbed and they are too scared. “As stakeholders of tourism 
in Khayelitsha we have decided to band together and work to see how do we remedy the situation,’’ said Mfuku.
