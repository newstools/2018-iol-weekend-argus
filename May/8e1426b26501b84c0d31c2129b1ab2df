How times have changed for the new Duchess of Sussex, who is thought to be on honeymoon at a mystery location with husband, Prince Harry. As a member of the British royal family and married to the sixth in line to the throne, Meghan has been given her own coat of arms. The blue background represents the Pacific Ocean off the California coast, while the two golden rays across the shield symbolise the sunshine of the Los Angeles-born royal’s home state. Beneath the shield on the grass are golden poppies - California’s state flower - and wintersweet, a shrub with a honey scent which grows at Kensington Palace, where she and Harry live. The fiersome lion and the white songbird holding up the shield are known as Supporters, with the former representing Harry and the latter Meghan. As a foreigner, Meghan will have had to record a pedigree proving her descent from a subject of the British Crown in the official registers of the College of Arms. Several family trees have shown that her father’s forebears include Mary Bird, an Irish-born maid who was recorded in 1856 as working at Windsor Castle- Daily Mail
