Kylie Jenner’s daughter Stormie’s paternity is reportedly in question, again. This time it is alleged that her bodyguard Tim Chung is Stormi’s real father. According to the reports, Travis Scott’s, mother, Wanda Webster, is demanding a paternity test after a photo of Kylie’s bodyguard went viral on social media. The photo compares Stormie’s picture with that of Chung's, against snaps of Stormie with Travis Scott. On Monday, an online music platform Hip Hop Heads tweeted: "Travis Scott's mother reportedly demands paternity test after Kylie Jenner bodyguard photo goes viral"      See how fans reacted to the allegations:                                         But according to 'HollywoodLife', Kylie and Scott rubbished the allegations:   Bang Showbiz previously reported that Kylie agreed to a paternity test to prove her Travis is Stormi's father. Kylie’s ex-boyfriend Tyga - whom she split from in April last year, also suggested that the two-month-old tot belongs to him, but later retracted the claim. IOL
