While many still have "Royal Wedding" fever following Prince Harry's marriage to Meghan Markle on Saturday, one person could not contain her contempt for the blushing bride, so Twitter read her for filth. English media personality Katie Hopkins got dragged after she made nasty remarks about Meghan, by comparing the former actress to her new sister-in-law, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge. On her Twitter account, Hopkins posted a collage of Catherine and Meghan in their wedding gowns, with the caption “No competition. You can’t buy class.”      Tweeps, however, went for the throat left her in shambles, and trolled her for shaming the new Duchess of Sussex, and quickly reminded her that while there's only a few years difference in her and Meghan's age, she hasn't aged quite was well. Reminder that Katie Hopkins is 43, 7 years older than Meghan Markle. Hate ages the body awfully kids pic.twitter.com/kXaTxIMKwo
