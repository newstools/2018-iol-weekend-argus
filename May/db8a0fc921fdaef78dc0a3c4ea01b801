Deputy principal Leon Kapp said Africa Day was an important event to celebrate and share the country’s diversity. “We pay a lot of attention and purpose to this particular event. We are in a unique situation. I think Maitland High is one of the very few schools that has the most diversity; these children come from the length and breadth of this continent. We have never closed our doors for any child from any community, local town or across the borders,” Kapp said. “Africa Day is significant for us in that we share our values, our togetherness and being African. We share the values of making sure the learners of this continent receive the very best education,” he said.  Kapp said he welcomed the expected announcement by the Basic Education Department of its plan to transform the system as an Afrocentric model. Pupil Lauren Koopman said: “I think Africa Day is important because we share the diversity, religions, cultures and backgrounds at school. “I learn from other cultures and we learn one another’s languages.”
