London - Britain's royal family released
the first two official photographs of newly born Prince Louis on
Sunday, one of which shows him being held by his sister Princess
Charlotte, aged three. Louis, who is fifth in line to the British throne, was born
on April 23 weighing 8lbs 7oz (3.83 kg). Both the photographs were taken at Kensington Palace by
Kate, the children's mother and wife of Prince William, Queen
Elizabeth's grandson. The first photograph, which the palace said was taken on
April 26, shows Louis propped up against a white cushion,
wearing a white jumper and trousers. The second photograph, taken on May 2, Charlotte's third
birthday, shows the princess holding her sleeping younger
brother affectionately. Due to a 2013 change in the law, Charlotte is the first
British princess for whom the arrival of a younger brother does
not mean being demoted down the line of succession. Palace officials said Louis would not join the rest of his
family at the May 19 wedding of his uncle, Prince Harry, to US actress Meghan Markle.
