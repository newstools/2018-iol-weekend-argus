Two weeks ago, a service delivery protest along Jakes Gerwel Drive and Highlands Drive led to one person’s death, damage to a petrol station and a fruit and vegetable stand, and forced road closures. This led to a stand-off between communities, with Mitchells Plain residents demanding that the people of Siqalo “go back to where you came from in the Eastern Cape”, and Siqalo residents accusing their neighbours of racial discrimination. In a bid to restore peace, Madikizela promised to move the people of Siqalo to a parcel of land in Philippi. Two months ago, residents of Philippi embarked on a two-week service protest. But according to Loyiso Nkohla, the head of community liaison officers for the City of Cape Town, it would take more than three years before the people realise a “new beginning”, which is what Siqalo means in isiXhosa. “How is he going to move people from Siqalo to Philippi without resolving the issues of people in that area? Besides that, there are processes which need to be followed,” said Nkohla. While Madikizela’s spokesperson Ntomboxolo Somdaka could not confirm when the more than 8000 people would be moved, she told Weekend Argus the move was dependent “on development plans”. She said an audit would be conducted into who would be afforded housing opportunities in the new project. Community leader Monwabisi Futshane told Weekend Argus: “We have not been told where we will be moved to. We do not trust him because there was nothing on paper.”  asanda.sokanyile@inl.co.za
