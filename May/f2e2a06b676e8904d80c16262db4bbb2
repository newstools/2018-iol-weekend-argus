In a joint press statement issued by the unions on Friday, they said bus employers are offering a 9% across-the-board wage increase for the first year as of the date of signature, which was May 11 and an 8% across-the-board increase for the second year. The offer also includes increases in nightshift, subsistence, cross border and tool allowances. However, unions said that their members were refusing this offer as employers did not want to backdate the agreement to April 1. The statement reads: “The general practice in any sector when on a strike is that the agreement is backdated to reflect the date when the new wage agreement is supposed 
to take effect, which in this 
case is the April 1, 2018. Instead, the employers want the agreement to be implemented 
from the date of signing and this is unacceptable to our members. “As unions in the sector we reject the attitude of the employers regarding the effective date of the agreement. We believe that they are provoking our members unnecessarily. We want to end the strike because we recognise that it is in the best interests of our members and the community at large. For every day that this strike drags on, workers suffer because of the “no work, no pay policy”. The strike is going into its fifth week and has had a ripple effect on all other forms of transportation. In Cape Town, people have complained of long taxi queues, congested roads and the impact it has had on their pockets. Melaney Roodt said travelling from Mitchells Plain without the bus service had become “extremely inconvenient”. “The train service only runs as far as Philippi on a good day and the waiting time for a taxi to town is a minimum of three hours, never mind the dangers of being on the roads that early to wait for a taxi.”
