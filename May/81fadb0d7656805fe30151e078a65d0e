Mallett, Botha and Willemse - whose bosses at SuperSport and MultiChoice said earlier in the week may be back in studio together this weekend - have been taken off air following Willemse's on-air walkout last Saturday. Matfield, Paulse and presenter Xola Ntshinga will discuss today’s Super Rugby action, which includes the local derby at Newlands between the Stormers and the Lions. The 40-man Bok squad for the June Tests against Wales and England will be released at 7pm. Last Saturday, Willemse walked off the SuperSport set during a live broadcast. The 2007 World Cup winner spoke of being labelled “a quota player” and “refused to be patronised by two individuals who played in the apartheid, segregated era”. Willemse said he had been glad what happened occurred on live television so viewers could see he “can’t work with people who undermine other people”.
