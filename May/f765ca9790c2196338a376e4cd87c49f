These are the questions that comedian Alan Committie will try to answer when he revives his romantic comedy Love Factually for a short run at the Baxter Theatre Flipside from this Tuesday. Committie first performed the show in 2016, following his long-running stint in Rob Becker’s Defending the Caveman. “I said after playing this role for eight or nine years I think I can go out and write my own version because it needs to be updated anyway. “Caveman speaks to the nature of relationships but we were never allowed to change the script because it’s not our text,” said Committie. Now with attitudes to relationships changing and societal norms shifting, Committie says he has the freedom to adapt his text. The show includes a touching and honest look at the nature of couples, the exploration of the absurd differences between men and women and the ups and downs of dating and marriage. Committie last performed the show in Cape Town 18 months ago and said this time around he’s made adjustments based on current cultural movements. “I don’t want to be flippant about the #MeToo movement or people transitioning and gender fluidity. “All of that is magnificent and I’m a big supporter, but at the same time I want to talk about relationships in a broader sense but not exclude what those things are,” he said. Committie commented that every comedian develops 
what works for him or her over time. “You can immerse yourself so much in your performance that you’ll be in the middle of a joke and suddenly you’ll think, did I record the latest Game of Thrones? “When you first become a comedian you’re really just mimicking your heroes on stage for the first five to six years of your career until you find your voice. “Because I’m trained in the theatre I was never a stand-up comedian and so I don’t do pure stand-up comedy,” said Committie. Love Factually runs until June 16.
