At eight weeks old, Zorg (then named James Bond) was adopted by Lindi Theron from Brackenfell, who saw him on Mdzananda’s Facebook page and was instantly smitten. “When I saw his little face I knew I had to bring him home. I said to my husband in Afrikaans, ‘Ek wil vir hom sorg,’ and that is how we got his name, Zorg,” said Theron. Today, Zorg is four years old, and both he and Theron have become representatives for Mdzananda. “I've been following Mdzananda’s work ever since I adopted Zorg,” said Theron. He was nursed back to health at the clinic and his sight was eventually restored.    Marcelle Du Plessis, fundraising and communications manager at Mdzananda said: “They were covering around 65% of our monthly expenses leaving us in an extremely difficult financial situation.” To keep the clinic alive, Mdzananda launched the Paw Member campaign in March, which involves getting people to sign up and donate R100 each month which will go towards the clinic. “If we can have 3000 people signing up, our deficit will be covered,” said Du Plessis. Theron has signed up for the campaign and both she and Zorg are now Paw Members.
