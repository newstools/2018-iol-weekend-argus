Reality star Khloe Kardashian took to social media on Saturday to mark the one-month milestone of her daughter, True. In a video shared on Instagram, Khloe can be heard saying: "Happy one-month old, mama. I love you, pretty girl." 💕Happy One Month True 💕 A post shared by  Khloé (@khloekardashian) on May 12, 2018 at 5:37am PDT Khloe and her boyfriend Tristan Thompson welcomed their daughter on 12 April, just days after video footage surfaced of the basketball player getting cosy with another woman in a nightclub. However, according to reports, Khloe “isn’t ready to give up” on her romance with Tristan, and is committed to "creating a life" with the NBA star in Cleveland, Ohio. Khloe has been keeping a low profile since the cheating allegations emerged, but has been spotted out and about over the past week. Khloe and Tristan were snapped on a lunch date at TownHall restaurant in Cleveland, and Khloe was spotted catching an afternoon stroll in the park with baby True.
