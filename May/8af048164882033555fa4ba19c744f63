CAPE TOWN - Can you believe it – the champions of South Africa against the champions of Spain? Well, you better get used to it, because that’s what’s happening on May 16 at the FNB Stadium: Mamelodi Sundowns will take on Barcelona. Eight-time Absa Premiership winners Sundowns announced on their Twitter account on Friday night that they will host Barca – who clinched their 25th La Liga title last week – at the home of South African soccer in less than two weeks’ time. Despite having wrapped up the Spanish championship already, Ernesto Valverde’s Barcelona still have four league games to complete their programme, starting with Sunday night’s El Clasico against Real Madrid at Camp Nou (8.45pm SA time). Barca will be keen to put one over their old foes as Zinedine Zidane’s Madrid are in the Champions League final, while the Catalan outfit were knocked out by Roma in the quarter-finals. After that, Barcelona take on Villarreal on Wednesday, May 9 and Levante on Sunday, May 13, before they will jet off to South Africa to clash with Sundowns on Wednesday, May 16 at the FNB Stadium (kickoff time to be confirmed). It is unclear at this stage whether the likes of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho will make the trip, with the World Cup coming up next month. Pitso Mosimane’s Sundowns have turned their attention to the Caf Champions League, as they battle with defending champions Wydad Casablanca on Saturday night. But with the league title secured, get ready to watch Percy Tau, Khama Billiat and Hlompho Kekana give Barca a bit of ‘Diski flavour’.    @ashfakmohamed IOL Sport   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
