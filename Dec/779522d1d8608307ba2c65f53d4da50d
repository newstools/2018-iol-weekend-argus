CAPE TOWN – Streaming movies or series to watch over the holiday is one great way to spend time with your friends and family. Satellite service DStv has a streaming app called DStv Now and users can also try out Netflix as both options allow users to download select TV shows and movies to watch offline later. Here are a few instructions that can help you work both of the options. 1. DSTV Now The app is available to all DStv users and allows subscribers to livestream all the same channels they do via their decoders. This can also be done on your phones, laptops, smart TVs or gaming consoles. When downloading movies and series to watch later, subscribers can connect to Wi-Fi and download DStv content to their devices via the DStv Now app to watch offline.
