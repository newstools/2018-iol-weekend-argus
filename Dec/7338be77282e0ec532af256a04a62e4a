Cape Town - A hidden camera in a small business that sells upmarket bicycles, spares and sundries in Long Street, Cape Town, has captured dramatic footage of the store being looted. Rook Cycles was looted after the festive lights switch-on in Cape Town's CBD on Sunday night. Owner Luke Godfrey said the shop would be closed until further notice. "We’re dealing with the aftermath. Obviously, we’re gutted. "We are so optimistic about South Africa. We’ve had opportunities to open elsewhere, but we’ve always stayed firm that this is where we need to be."
