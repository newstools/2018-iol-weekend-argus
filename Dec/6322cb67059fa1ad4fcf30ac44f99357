The Lighthouse Academy in Mossel Bay is celebrating after its pupils won first prize in the international November Numeracy Challenge. The inter-schools competition was run by 3P Learning, creators of the online maths resource “Mathletics”. Students from the UK, Europe, the Middle East and Africa competed online for points to become their nation’s best mathletes. Pupils also raised money for the UN International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) with each point gained corresponding to a cash donation to charity. The competition, now in its third year, aims to inspire children to become enthusiastic and confident mathematicians. At the end of the competition, the school that has the most points is crowned the winner. Second and third place also receive money towards the renewal of their Mathletics subscription, as well as a celebration pack. Lighthouse Academy teacher Dee Robus said: “We are completely thrilled to have achieved first place in a competition involving so many other schools and pupils. This is a real testament to the hard work of staff and children, huge congratulations to all involved. “Since introducing Mathletics to the classroom we have seen a real change in our pupils’ attitude toward maths.”
