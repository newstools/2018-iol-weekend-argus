Cape Town - Masiphumelele commuters will benefit from new taxi facility which should be ready by early next year, the City of Cape Town said. "The new minibus-taxi facility on the corner of Kommetjie and Pokela Roads in Masiphumelele in the Far South is on track to be completed by February 2019," the City of Cape Town said in a statement. "The project commenced in May this year. I drive past this site almost every day and have been keeping an eye on the progress," mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Felicity Purchase said. "I’m pleased to say that the contractor is on track to complete the new facility by the end of February next year. This is good news as we are heading into the builders’ holiday period, meaning about 3 300 commuters from Masiphumelele will be using this brand new facility early in 2019." Approximately 60 minibus-taxis will operate from the new facility, which will serve commuters travelling to and from Simon’s Town, Fish Hoek, Noordhoek, and Kommetjie. "It’s important to mention that, apart from the new transport infrastructure, the local residents and sub-contractors are also benefitting from temporary employment opportunities and tenders. In fact, at least R461 000 has been spent to date on temporary work opportunities for local residents. A further R230 000 has been spent to date on the procurement of goods and services from local sub-contractors from the area," Purchase said. The minibus-taxi operators are currently operating from Erf 1728 – a vacant erf with no services or facilities for commuters and operators. Local residents are exposed to wind, sun, and rain while they are waiting for taxis, and there are no ablution facilities or safe walkways. The new minibus-taxi facility will provide residents with a safe and dignified area for waiting and connecting with their fellow commuters. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
