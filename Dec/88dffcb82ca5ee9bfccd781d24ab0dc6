Radiantly glowing in a one-shouldered black dress by Givenchy, the Duchess of Sussex made a surprise appearance at the British Fashion Awards. But it wasn't her beautiful dress or fresh-faced makeup that got people talking - it was her expanding baby bump. Her growing tummy stole the spotlight while presenting an award to her wedding dress designer, Clare Waight Keller. Keller was honoured as British women's wear designer of the year. While looking on as Keller delivered her acceptance speech, Markle protectively cradled her bump.   The two collaborated on Markle's stunning wedding dress in May as she walked down the aisle to wed her real life Prince Charming, Harry. This will be the royal couple's first child. No word yet if they are expecting a girl or boy, but Buckingham Palace has confirmed the birth is due for the spring of 2019. There are also plans for them to relocate to Frogmore Cottage before baby arrives.
