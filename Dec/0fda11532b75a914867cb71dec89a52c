 Cyril Ramaphosa last night said Bathabile Dlamini raised the bar. Cyril is afraid of Bathabile, he knows very well that if he touches her, his Smallernyana skeletons will be out. #RamaphosaOn702 pic.twitter.com/p5lqstEM6U   YOU can't separate Bathabile Dlamini and the "bar" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚#RamaphosaOn702   This drunkard mismanaged @OfficialSASSA into near collapse and the constitutional court found her reckless and grossly negligent yet @PresidencyZA @CyrilRamaphosa praises her.This sums up why SA is falling apart and why the ANC can't be trusted. #RamaphosaOn702 https://t.co/zaFEWTa4ZH   According to our Prez #BathabileDlamini has raised the bar, NO she's holding up the bar, big difference! But hey, carry on, bullshit baffles brains ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚  Great interview last night @gwalax @CyrilRamaphosa I have a lot of faith in our president except for his recommendation of #bathabiledlamini - which is an insult to women everywhere. We have such a problem with violence against women & children & itâ€™s just getting worse ðŸ˜”   Iâ€™m not satisfied with our Presidentâ€™s response on #BathabileDlamini. She definitley has smaller-nyana skeletons on the ANC leadership. pic.twitter.com/o7WRnLU2Xd   I think ubaba left Batha with some files hence Cyril can't do anything to her #RamaphosaOn702
