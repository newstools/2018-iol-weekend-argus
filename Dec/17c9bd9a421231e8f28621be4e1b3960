Christ Embassy Church in Verulam was robbed by four gun-wielding men on Saturday afternoon. The pastor, Dr Shane Maharaj, said a group of youth worshippers had gone to the church on Saturday to put up Christmas decorations when one was accosted by four men in a Toyota Fortuner. “They caught one of the youths and took him into the house near the church, which we use to store things. They hit him and then locked him in the toilet,” Maharaj said. “They took the TV, speakers and amplifiers, which were all donated to the church.” He said the youth, who was assaulted, had bruising over his body and was treated for anxiety. “There is no respect and honour. They have stolen from the house of God and from the poor for themselves,” he said. Maharaj said it was not the first time the church was targeted. Whoonga vagrants would often steal light bulbs, but this robbery was carried out by an organised gang, he said. Prem Balram, spokesperson of security company Reaction Unit SA (Rusa), said they were called to the scene by one of the victims reporting the robbery. He said one of the worshippers was robbed of his cellphone. Balram said they searched extensively for the men, but no arrests were made. In another robbery at a place of worship, balaclava-wearing armed robbers broke into the Silverglen Mosque and pistol-whipped the caretaker. They stole the public address system and other mosque items. The gate, door and other parts of the mosque were damaged. The caretaker was robbed of his money and belongings. Daily News
