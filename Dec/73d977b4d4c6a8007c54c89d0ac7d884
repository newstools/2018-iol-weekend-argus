Cape Town – A grieving family in Hillview, Seawinds, and their neighbours are reeling in shock after two Rottweilers mauled a 6-year-old boy to death in their full view. Uriel Ockhuis, 6, of 32 Gladiola Street, Hillview, was playing with friends around the block in Rose Street when he was attacked by two Rottweilers. The boy’s traumatised adult brother, Morne Ockhuis, older sister Stacey-Lee Adams, neighbour Rachel Waterloo and bystanders tried to help, but to no avail. He was bitten 72 times. “It will take some time before I can say how I feel because I’m still in shock,” said Morne. Distraught, Waterloo said Uriel had been lying on his stomach screaming for help when they arrived and “the dogs wouldn’t let go of him”. Adams said: “When we got to hospital with Uriel I couldn’t bear to look at him because I was too heartsore. There are a lot of people here who have been traumatised by what they saw. He would have started going to school next year.” SAPS Captain FC van Wyk said Muizenberg police responded to the call at about 6.45pm. “The victim was taken to a hospital (in Retreat) by neighbours and was declared dead on arrival. An inquest docket has been registered at Muizenberg SAPS,” said Van Wyk.
