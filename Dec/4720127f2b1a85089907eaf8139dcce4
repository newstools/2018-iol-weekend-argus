Cape Town - South Africans will know on Sunday the name of a new party they could vote for in next year’s general elections when its founder, Patricia de Lille, makes the announcement. After two weeks of guessing, the former Cape Town mayor and DA member is also expected to introduce a team of young leaders who were involved in the party’s policy development. De Lille will make the big announcements in Johannesburg in an attempt to garner national support. The DA, which is regarded as the largest opposition party, launched its campaign for next year’s general elections in Joburg in September. But its support has dwindled along with that of the governing ANC. De Lille said her new political party would break the racial and geographical stereotypes which were as a result of apartheid. “The party is for all South Africans - it’s not focused on the Western Cape only. We plan to contest the national and provincial elections and have received overwhelming response from across the country,” said De Lille. She would not name any high-profile people who might have indicated interest in joining the party, saying it was open to everyone including ordinary people who wanted to build a good country but hinted that young potential leaders would find a home in the party. “I am amazed at what the young people have to offer. South Africa needs a new breed of young leaders and we need to start grooming them now. They have a lot to offer through working with them, I have learnt a lot,” said De Lille. Although the party’s manifesto and policy were still being thrashed out, facilitators in each province had already been appointed. Weekend Argus
