Groblersdal - Limpopo police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba on Saturday condemned the murder of a three-year-old boy at Groblersdal and warned the perpetrators that they will be "hunted down". This followed after a three-year-old boy was found murdered on Friday in the bushes next to Koting village in the Marble Hall policing area outside Groblersdal, Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said. "It is alleged that a passerby made this gruesome discovery and alerted the police who reacted swiftly to the scene of crime. Upon arrival, the deceased was found lying in a pool of blood and also stones lying next to his body, which is suspected to be the weapon used during the commission of this heinous act.
