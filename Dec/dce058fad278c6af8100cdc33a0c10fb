Durban - A Blue Security armed response officer made a grisly discovery when he found the bodies of two foetuses that had been dumped with refuse in Durban North on Monday. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said the officer was on a routine patrol when some vagrants who were digging in the trash flagged his vehicle down in Lynne Avenue in Glen Ashley. The incident occurred at around 6.30am. "The officer stopped to investigate and discovered the two foetuses, who appeared to be twins, lying between black bags of trash on the grass verge of a property. It is believed the bodies may have been dumped at the site just a few hours earlier," Mathios said. "Our officer immediately cordoned off the area and called the Durban North SAPS who responded to the scene to investigate further to establish who the mother may be and who may have dumped the babies," Mathios said.
