Johannesburg - Former Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille has officially announced the name of her new party which will be contesting in the 2019 elections. “Today I am proud to honour that promise and announce that the movement is named 'Good'. The movement's name and identity is here for all of you to see. It is a simple and authentic name that says quite boldly: we stand for and that we are here to disrupt politics as usual,” De Lille said. De Lille made the announcement at the Houghton Foxwood Hotel. The announcement comes just two weeks after she said that she will be starting a new movement. At the press conference were a few familiar faces; former DA chief whip Shaun August was present and former Mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Brett Herron was also there.     De Lille's movement is based on four key themes: spatial justice, social justice, economic justice and environmental justice. “Race and space have defined the life and opportunities for centuries. No democratic government has tackled apartheid's spatial legacy. It persists in our country,” she said. De Lille said they are developing their detailed policy position and their election manifesto which will be revealed in January 2019. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
