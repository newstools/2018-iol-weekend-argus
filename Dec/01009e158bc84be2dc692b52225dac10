The exhibition, Ma se Kinders, is a homage to the mothers and grandmothers of Hangberg and seeks to thank them for their contribution to the area. He said that when he went to work in Hangberg about three years ago he was welcomed with open arms and learnt about their fighting spirit. “This is is an important path in my life. I chose Hangberg because it is a microcosm of the Western Cape. The community has strong knowledge of self and community that is why I want to give back.” Born in the Cape Flats, Christian was known by some as the “unofficial photographer of the revolution” because of his work and involvement in the #FeesMustFall movement. “It is great that the world is finally catching up. I feel humbled and feel the love. I work every day, I haven’t shared with the world some of my other mediums, but when they are done I will.” He said he was inspired by the ocean and his dreams and not by worldly or modern things. “I am living out the wildest dreams of my ancestors. I am keeping my work pure and simple.” He said using different mediums like painting and sculpture allowed different parts of his personality to manifest. Christian’s portraits will be sold from Sneaker LAB’s Braamfontein store and all proceeds will be put back into uplifting the Hangberg community through a variety of initiatives.
