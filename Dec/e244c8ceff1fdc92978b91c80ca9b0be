Storey allegedly went to an OK Mini Market store in Parow on November 16 and produced a false electronic document showing she had transferred money into their account for purchases. “In this case it had been found that she also attempted to do the same thing at Edgars for about R12m and Foschini for R21m. She has separate cases opened against her for that,” said Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase. Storey has since been remanded in custody and her case postponed to late January for a bail application. Nkwalase said the authenticity of documents should always be checked as there were often clues which would indicate that they were fake. He suggested going through documents with a fine-tooth comb and checking whether the stamp had the correct details and colour. “In a separate case, we had Abdul Karriem Janodien appear in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court for allegedly also providing fraudulent documents to get vehicle finance. “A Mercedes-Benz and a BMW were recovered from Janodien worth a total of R178 3277,” said Nkwalase. Janodien was released on R10 000 bail and the case remanded to January 25 for further investigation. However, two more arrests were made this week. “Two suspects were found to have been aiding Janodien in creating fraudulent documents,” said Nkwalase. He added that extra vigilance was needed, especially during the festive season, and people must always check before performing any transactions.
