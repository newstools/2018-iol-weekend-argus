Durban - The father of Kiyan Singh - the eight-year-old uMhlanga boy killed in a freak accident when he was struck by a goal post during strong winds last Friday - has paid tribute to his son, whom he described as a 'gentle sweet baby'. Dr Sahil Singh, a well-known dermatologist in Durban, said he received the news of the death of his son while he was in the UK at a store to buy his son a goalie set. “He had several goalie kits and his wishlist when I was in the UK was for the Manchester United kids goalie set. It was exactly what I was looking for when I received the call that there was an accident and had to immediately make arrangements to return home,” said Singh. The accident happened at the Riverside sportsground during a match between local clubs Riverside and Juventus football clubs’ junior teams. Kiyan was a substitute goalkeeper for the local side Juventus. He had been standing on the sidelines of the pitch when the goal post struck him. Singh said the tragic loss of his son has been difficult for him and family to deal with. “He would practice in his goals every day with his brother. My baby soccer player passed away in his goals in the end doing what he absolutely loved the most. It was a cruel and merciless ending for his beautiful life. He will never be forgotten by anyone who knew him. Of this I’m certain.”
