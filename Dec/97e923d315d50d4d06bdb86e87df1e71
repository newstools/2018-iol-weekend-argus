Durban - Power giant, Eskom, has implemented Stage 2 rotational load shedding from 9 am until 10 pm. "Stage 2 calls for 2000MW to be rotationally load shed nationally at a given period. Loadshedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout," Eskom said. Eskom is urging customers to continue using electricity sparingly. The new schedule consists of four stages with the rotation in the most likely period of load-shedding (06:00 - 22:00, Monday to Saturday) as follows:- Stage 1: Residential/Commercial Blocks - load-shed once every second dayStage 2: Residential/Commercial Blocks - load-shed once every dayStage 3: Residential/Commercial/Industrial Blocks - load-shed once every dayStage 4: Residential/Commercial/Industrial Blocks - load-shed once every day. Residential and Commercial will be shed for an additional block on alternate days.  All blocks are scheduled for a 2-hour outage with an additional 30 minutes contingency to cater for switching. Sometimes, technical difficulties in restoring electricity may occur and should a customer remain off for a substantial amount of time after the Block has been scheduled to be restored, then that incident must be treated as a fault and reported to the Electricity Contact Centre on 080 1313 111.
