Cape Town - Two members of the recently established, much vaunted Anti-Gang Unit have been arrested by their fellow members. The arrests follow an investigation into a complaint of theft, which is believed to have occurred during a raid in Mitchells Plain. "Detectives from the AGU arrested two police officers from the same Unit for theft this (Tuesday) morning. The arrests follow an investigation into a theft complaint after the Unit executed a raid in Mitchell’s Plain recently," police spokesperson FC van Wyk said. Western Cape police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula said SAPS would not allow any form of corruption to "seep into the Unit members". "No SAPS member is above the law," Jula said, "and we will not allow any of our members to perpetrate a crime and get away with it. "We are confident this morning’s arrests will send a stern warning," Jula said. The two constables, a 35-year-old male and a 38-year-old female, attached to Western Cape Anti-Gang Unit Visible Policing Section are accused of stealing money from a residence in Peugeot Street, Beacon Valley in Mitchells Plain where they conducted a search on 29 November 2018, Van Wyk said. "The complainant discovered that cash was taken from a safe in his house after they had left and reported the matter to police. It is also alleged that the two constables approached the complainant again on 2 December 2018 and requested him to withdraw the case against them in return for the stolen money. The two suspects are detained until their court appearance in Mitchells Plain on Thursday 6 December 2018 on a charge of theft," Van Wyk said. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus Check out the new IOL Application Google Play Store Apple App Store
