Cape Town – Another MyCiTi bus was set alight in Woodstock on Monday night. According to the City's Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson, Theo Layne, "the driver of the bus sustained serious injuries", while the only passenger is in a "non-critical" condition. Layne said Fire and Rescue Service vehicles – two fire engines and a rescue vehicle – were at the scene on the corner of Lawley and Roodebloom roads at 21.56pm. The bus was reportedly stopped, had petrol poured inside and was set alight. Both the driver and passenger were believed to have sustained burn injuries. Last Wednesday, another MyCiTi bus was targeted in Mitchells Plain. A petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle, but luckily the bus was only slightly dented.

Before these incidents, three MyCiTi buses had been set alight since the start of a strike in October and three others damaged, with the damage estimated by the City at R13 million. Last month, the MyCiTi bus operating company Kidrogen axed 40% of its drivers after they failed to attend disciplinary hearings after being issued with notices for taking part in an illegal strike.
