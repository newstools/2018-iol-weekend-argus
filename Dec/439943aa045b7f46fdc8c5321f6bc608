Cape Town - After being robbed of more than R70 000 on Sunday afternoon, the World of Birds Wildlife Sanctuary in Hout Bay managed to crowdfund nearly R80 000 to help repay debt to keep its doors open. Its owner, Walter Mangold, 81, was found bound by telephone cables in his office on Sunday afternoon. At about 4pm, Walter collected the day's takings from the café and made his way to his office a few meters away. “I placed the monies in the safe and sat at my desk when two men entered the office. One guy had me in a choke-hold and knocked me from the chair, got on top of me and held my face down,” Mangold said. “They cut the telephone wires and tied me up tightly by my hands and feet. It was extremely painful. They wanted to stuff a blanket in my mouth. All I asked was for them not to hurt me.” Walter was discovered facedown by tourists after he shouted for help. The private sanctuary has served the greater Cape Town community for more than 40 years, providing free care to more than 2000 permanently injured birds and small mammals. Since June this year they have struggled to keep their doors open. The weekend takings, totalling more than R70 000, was to be paid over to the bank. They owe R850 000. Hoping to raise funds to keep their doors open and to make up for the lost funds, World of Birds have set up a campaign on donations based crowdfunding platform, BackaBuddy, to appeal to the public for support. "Since the robbery at World of Birds, over R79 123 has been crowdfunded on BackaBuddy with contributions from 139 donors to support the beloved sanctuary after their ordeal," said Zane Groenewald, BackaBuddy, Public Relations Officer.
