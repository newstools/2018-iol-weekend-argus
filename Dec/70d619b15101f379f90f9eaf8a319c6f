A report detailing the upgrades states that in 2014 a threat analysis was performed on De Lille's private home by the police. The threat analysis identified that threats existed at De Lille’s home, which called for security upgrades at her home. The upgrades in 2014 followed the normal procurement process by obtaining quotes and going on tender. The installation of the Trellidor security gates at De Lille’s house amounted to R140139.98 (which was 28% of the original 2014 risk assessment). The Auditor-General was of the opinion that management had failed to monitor compliance with the applicable laws and regulations as the grounds for deviating from the procurement process were not valid or compliant with the Municipal Supply Chain Management Regulations of 2005. Asked for comment, De Lille said: “I have again been vindicated. I have said that this was a witch-hunt from the beginning.” Cape Argus
