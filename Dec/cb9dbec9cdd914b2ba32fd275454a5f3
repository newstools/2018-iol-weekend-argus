Johannesburg - Trevor Noah used his recent trip to South Africa to pay a visit to his grandmother, where the two talked about a range of topics, including Nelson Mandela and the comedian's upbringing. The renowned comedian, who was in the country to host the Global Citizen Festival, paid a special visit to his 91-year-old grandmother,Â Nomalizo Frances Noah, ahead of the festival. The visit saw Noah's grandmother share fond memories of Mandela and talk of the horrors of the apartheid apartheid era. The TV host shared his visit on his Facebook page on Tuesday morning. In the eight-minute clip, Noah's grandmother talks of her impression of the late statesman, who she described as "like a god for black people". "He was just like our god on Earth... really," she fondly shared. She also regaled the audience with memories of Noah's childhood, describing him as handsome but energetic and naughty child. The clip rounded off with Noah asking his grandmother if she watched his show, to which she cheekily responded she was unable to due to load shedding. Watch the clip below:
