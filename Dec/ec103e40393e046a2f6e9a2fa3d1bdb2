The waste recovery project was slammed by the National Treasury, which ordered the municipality to start the tender process from scratch. However, the Department of Environmental Affairs recently awarded the project an integrated environmental authorisation. The department’s spokesperson, Albi Modise, said the environmental authorisation did not have a bearing on the cancellation of the project. “The authorisation remains valid. Another applicant or this applicant can therefore still decide to tender for the project in future,” Modise said. Interwaste spokesperson Larry Eichstadt said the project cancellation did not cancel the memorandum of agreement between the municipality and Interwaste. “The energy component is the sensitive aspect, but the other components play an important part in responding to the national waste hierarchy,” Eichstadt said. However, the Wellington Association Against The Incinerator, said they were appealing the authorisation. “We have a very strong case against the impact report and the waste incinerator, said spokesperson Keith Roman.
