DURBAN - Making a wave of a different kind, the extension to the Durban beach promenade is fast taking shape. This recent aerial image shows the bare concrete outline of the promenade, and city officials say in less than a year, the project will be complete. Head of Durban Tourism, Phillip Sithole, says a 500m-long concrete slab has been laid, in the unique wave formation. Another 250m will be undertaken in the new year, making the new extension a 750m addition to the existing 7.25km promenade. “In the new year, we will complete the rest of the promenade. We will also begin the tiling of the concrete slab in the same pattern as that of the rest of the promenade that people are familiar with,” he said.  The R275-million project began earlier this year, and is expected to be open to the public in November 2019. “Much of the construction is not visible to people, but it is taking shape. Come next year November, people will see the new section of the promenade as well as its facilities such as ablution places, club facilities, lifeguard towers, and changerooms,” he said. Sithole said Transnet would be responsible for another 500m of the promenade that would extend into the harbour side.
