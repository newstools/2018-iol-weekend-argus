Cape Town - The City of Cape Town's last full council sitting of 2018 saw the adoption of mayor Dan Plato's new mayoral committee structure. The City said the new structure would enhance service delivery. "Council’s approval today of the revised Organisational Development and Transformation Plan (ODTP) is a vote of confidence for the establishment of a new Mayoral Committee (Mayco) structure," mayor Dan Plato said. "I believe that this structure will promote a more streamlined focus, allowing for more effective and efficient service delivery to the people of Cape Town. "In November, when I announced the new Mayco members (the same number of members as the previous Mayoral Committee), who today have been allocated their portfolios, I said that I have chosen this team as they have demonstrated their ability to carry out their duties with excellence, they have demonstrated their commitment to work together as a united committee, and for their passion to serve the people of this city. They have shown their eagerness in recent weeks to address some of the shortcomings that have already been identified and we have discussed some of the exciting plans that they want to implement," Plato said. "I have full faith in this diverse, energised and fit-for-purpose Mayoral Committee and I am confident that the people of Cape Town will immediately begin to feel their positive impact," he said. The new structure is as follows: Deputy Mayor and Finance - Ian Neilson Community Services and Health - Dr Zahid Badroodien Corporate Services - Sharon Cottle Economic Opportunities and Asset Management - James Vos Energy and Climate Change - Phindile Maxiti Human Settlements - Malusi Booi Safety and Security - J P Smith Spatial Planning and Environment - Marian Nieuwoudt Transport - Felicity Purchase  Urban Management - Grant Twigg Water and Waste - Xanthea Limberg "I have said it several times in recent weeks, and I will continue to say it so that nobody forgets why we are here: effective and efficient service delivery is the top priority for this administration and we will deliver on this mandate by working with our communities, with active partners, and with anyone who shares our vision of a united and well run City of Cape Town, because we will make progress possible, together," Plato said. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
