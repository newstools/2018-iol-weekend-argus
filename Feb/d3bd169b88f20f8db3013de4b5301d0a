His split from DJ Zinhle and the public spats have been a talking point since the rapper admitted to cheating on Zinhle with Bonang. The Supa Mega admitted on Real Talk with Anele that he’d handled the split with Zinhle wrongly. “The start of my relationship (with Bonang) was painful because at the time I was in a relationship with my baby mama. And she was pregnant — what we put her through was wrong. And I’ve apologised for that. And I’m sorry for that. And maybe she (Bonang) will apologise for it one day as well.” He said there was no joy in how he handled his split with Zinhle. “Zinhle is a great woman, a strong woman. A great mother. I was too stupid and too young to even recognise that and even see that. For me, it was never about taking joy. We (he and Bonang) just found each other.” He claimed that he and Bonang had broken up again - we’ve lost count - on social media. “There are some things I want to talk about, in terms of the insides of our relationship. “But I would be less of a man if I said and explained everything. “I’m taking it one day at a time. I got my daughter. I got my music. I got my friends. I got my health. I got my family. I got my money.” And, he says, he’s not dating. “I believe I’m still dealing with it. I’m not going to say I am over her. I am not going to say I don’t love her. I do. All of those things.” - Staff Reporter
