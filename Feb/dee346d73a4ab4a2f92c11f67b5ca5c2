"I have therefore come to the decision to resign as president of the republic with immediate effect," Zuma said. "Even though I disagree with the decision of the leadership of my organisation, I have always been a disciplined member of the ANC," he said. "No life should be lost in my name. And also the ANC should not be divided in my name." Earlier in his speech, Zuma effectively accused the ANC of violating his rights by recalling him without telling him what he had done wrong.  "I don't fear exiting political office, however I have only asked my party to articulate my transgressions and the reason for its immediate instruction that I vacate office," he said.  He said his disagreement was aimed at protecting the rule of law and his rights.  "I'm not clinging to power, I just  wanted to the respect for the rule of law and my rights," he said.
