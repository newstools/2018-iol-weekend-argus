Johannesburg - The woman who was assaulted allegedly by ANC members as she helplessly lay on the ground outside Luthuli House on Monday said she just wanted water, electricity and a house. Nkateko Makete spoke out for the first time on Tuesday, saying she was not there to protest but wanted service delivery. Makete and her husband, Robert, who was also assaulted, were part of a group from an informal settlement in Orange Farm Extension 10 who went to town to hand over a memorandum of demands to MEC for Human Settlements, Cooperative Government and Traditional AffairsÂ  Paul Mashatile. Makete is a member of Black First Land First (BLF). On Monday, clashes broke out between "protect Luthuli House supporters" and BLF members who were protesting outside the ANC's headquarters. One of the BLF's demands includes a demand that President Jacob Zuma to remain the head of state until the end of his term next year. "I did not know that there was a protest. I went there because we have no houses, water and electricity in our informal settlement. "Our vehicle took the wrong turn and we were attacked by ANC members. I was kicked so hard with booted feet. I could not walk in the morning. I was in so much pain," Makete said. The community said they held a meeting about lack of service delivery on Sunday night and decided to draw up a memorandum to be handed over to Mashatile the following day. ANC members who want Zuma to step down protested outside Luthuli House on Monday. The chanted slogans and violence broke out when a bakkie carrying a group of residents from the informal settlement was attacked. ANC Joburg secretary Thabiso Setona handed himself over to the police on Monday night. @smashaba The Star Read more: Unmasked: ANC thug who attacked a woman
