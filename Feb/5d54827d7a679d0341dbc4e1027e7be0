The 57-year-old administrator at the Springfield Convent School in Wynberg was reported missing on Thursday afternoon and the burning vehicle was discovered that night. On Friday, social media was rife with speculation that the body found in the car was that of Packham. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said the SAPS could confirm Packham had been reported missing by a relative at the Diep River police station late on Thursday afternoon. “Mrs Packham was last seen leaving her Constantia residence yesterday morning in her green BMW sedan.

On Friday, police cordoned off the Packham family’s home in The Vines, near 
Constantia. The patch of grass where the gutted car was found near the Diep River station was still smouldering when Weekend Argus visited the scene Friday afternoon. Springfield Convent School’s PR and marketing spokesperson Penny Boock said the school had been asked by the Packham family not to provide information to the media “out of respect for the family”. Boock confirmed Packham had been employed as an administrator at the school. She declined to say whether Packham had arrived for work on Thursday morning. The organisation Pink Ladies, which helps search for missing people, said in a Facebook post: “Gill Packham left home in Constantia at approx 07H00 yesterday morning (Thursday) to go to work at Springfield High School but did not arrive. “It is not known what she is wearing. She was driving a dark green BMW 3 series”. Packham’s husband Rob Packham and daughters Nicola and Kerry Anne could not be contacted on Friday 
and neighbours declined to discuss Packham’s disappearance. Weekend Argus
