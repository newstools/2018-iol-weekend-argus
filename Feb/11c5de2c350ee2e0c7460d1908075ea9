Ward 14 councillor Bongokwakhe Mbambo on Thursday said party members and locals alike were looking forward to Zuma’s return. “He has always said he will return to the branch once he steps down. We want him back to help grow the ANC in the area,” Mbambo said. Former ward 14 councillor Sbongiseni Bhengu said the community would hold welcome celebrations fit for a 
former president. “This is a great man and although we are hurt that he was forced out of leading this country, he is a son of the soil here and we are looking forward to having him back,” Bhengu said. A group of ANC members from the local branch braved the heat and gathered outside Zuma’s house on Thursday. They avoided speaking to the media but expressed their feelings in pro-Zuma songs. However, Zuma’s family did not mince their words when describing their feelings over his recall. Zuma’s brother, Khanya Zuma, said the family was struggling to come to terms with the “sudden” end of Zuma’s term in the presidency. “He spent his life fighting for the liberation of this country,” Khanya said. Khanya’s wife, Sabani Zuma, who fondly referred to the former president as bhuti (brother), said although Zuma had survived many “attacks” during his presidency, many in the family were not as strong as he was and had been suffering in silence. “My heart sank when I saw him resigning because I knew it was not his will. He still had a year to work for this country,” she said. Bhengu said he was proud of Zuma. He said the former president represented South Africa to the best of his ability. Daily News
