Speaking at a Water (In)Justice conference on Saturday organised by the Diocese of Cape Town, Makgoba, who heads the Anglican Church in South Africa and some neighbouring countries, said we need to sustain efforts to save water. “I have so much hope, let’s look at what we have in terms of desalination and that there is reduced usage from the agriculture sector. This helps us to change our thinking and save more when we see Day Zero coming. “We need to sustain this reduction and encourage people that if Day Zero does not come we should not be cynical and we shouldn’t say it was all a lie or electioneering but rather respect that we have avoided it and maintain our water usage,” he said. His faith made him uneasy with the idea of Day Zero. “In a biblical perspective the concept of void and nihilism does not sit well because we take the creation story seriously because in the beginning God acted and there was day one so Day Zero could be the beginning of not having water in our taps but we can overcome that, whereas zero means the end, which is why I prefer to say day one,” he said. Makgoba said religious institutions could play a role in helping to reduce water and that people should “soak the crisis with prayer”. “I’m positive this conference can bring together an interfaith community as well because over 80% of South Africans are religious. I hope they hear these messages in their places of worship and bring the saving methods they learn home with them. “There is a beautiful significance to this crisis happening over Lent because it gives us time to reflect on our water usage. Cape Town is in a drought and that’s the desert, then Day Zero could be the crucifixion ,and the resurrection follows the crucifixion, so this too shall pass, but it requires working together.” Weekend Argus
