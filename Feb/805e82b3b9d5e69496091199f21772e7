Johannesburg - The Hawks - the elite crime busters in South Africa - on Wednesday morning raided the Saxonwold home of the Guptas, , spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi said. A police officer at the compound blocked off access to Saxonwold Drive, saying: "This is a crime scene." The Gupta family are at the centre of an ongoing state capture probe in which they allegedly used undue influence to score lucrative contracts from state-owned enterprises. They have a close relationship with President Jacob Zuma and his family.  The raid is the latest in a series of recent moves by the Hawks into investigating state capture allegations as revealed in the public protector’s report, and the so-called Gupta leaks.
