Cape Town - In a bid to promote healthy living, Cape Town residents have been invited to join President Cyril Ramaphosa for daily morning walks. The morning exercise will see Ramaphosa walk from the Gugulethu sports ground to Athlone Stadium from February 20, 2018. The daily walks will begin at 5.30am. The newly-elected president made waves last week when he was captured walking along the Sea Point Promenade with former finance minister Trevor Manuel on Thursday morning.
