CAPE TOWN - Google has decided that it will be removing the “view image” option that appeared when you clicked on a picture.  The button was previously used by users when searching for a picture and they wanted to see it independently to save it instead of going to it's original site. The reason behind the removal is that, Google has been under fire from photographers and publishers who felt that image search allowed people to steal their pictures. A deal to show copyright information and improve attribution of Getty photos was announced last week and included these changes. The intention seems to be either stopping people from taking an image altogether or driving them through to the website where the image is found. This would also let people  see any associated copyright information. Additionally, This would allow websites who have adverts to get more revenue. Today we're launching some changes on Google Images to help connect users and useful websites. This will include removing the View Image button. The Visit button remains, so users can see images in the context of the webpages they're on. pic.twitter.com/n76KUj4ioD    READ ALSO: Google will finally block "intrusive and annoying ads" READ ALSO: WATCH: Google features can hep you get better travel rates TOP STORY:Gigaba caught playing Candy crush during Ramaphosa announcement - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
