The Young Peoples’ Convention (YPC) brought together young people between the ages of 14 to 35. This includes adolescents, young parents, married couples, divorcees, as well as young widows and widowers. An estimated 40 000 people attended the event. It is the first major event since the merge of the two District Churches south-east Africa and the Cape region that created the entity NAC southern Africa. The YPC is to be a signal for this new unity in the church body. The YPC started on Saturday with a five-hour variety concert, which brought together performers and dance groups from across the country. Last Friday, local congregants welcomed between 1 200 and 1 600 youths from other provinces, who were accommodated at their congregants homes. The church service was conducted by chief apostle Jean-Luc Schneider, who is the international leader of the NAC. In 2008, the NAC held a mass youth service at the then Sahara Park Cricket Stadium (Newlands Cricket Stadium).  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
