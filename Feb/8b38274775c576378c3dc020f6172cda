Durban - Philani Ntuli, the man accused of kidnapping and murdering Durban teen Siam Lee has claimed that he fears for his life since his arrest. Ntuli claimed in court on Friday morning that he was suffocated and assaulted on the day of his arrest. “I was told I will either confess or be taken out in a body bag,” he said. Ntuli has requested that he be transferred to the Westville prison while investigations continue. Addressing Magistrate Mohamed Motala, he said his relatives had been turned away from the Durban North police station where he is being held when they come to visit. According to Ntuli, the police have assaulted him.

At Friday's appearance, a further remand was requested for the provincial task team to familiarise itself with the case. Magistrate Motala suggested that Ntuli be sent to the Durban Central holding cells, but he declined. He said if he was being sent to another police cell, he would rather go back to the Durban North police station. Motala ruled that Ntuli be sent to Durban North SAPS, and that police act within the ambit of the law. Lee’s friends and family filed into court and were visibly upset at Ntuli’s claims. His defence team, led by Carl van der Merwe, has since withdrawn from the case. The matter is due back in court next week. Daily News
